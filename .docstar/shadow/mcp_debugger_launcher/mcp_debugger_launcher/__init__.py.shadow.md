## Purpose
Standard Python package initialization file that enables the `mcp_debugger_launcher` directory to be treated as a package by the Python import system.

## Structure
- **Package marker (L1)**: Single comment explaining the file's purpose
- **Empty implementation**: No classes, functions, or executable code defined

## Dependencies
None - this is a minimal package initialization file.

## Architectural Context
This is a typical `__init__.py` pattern for Python packages. The file is intentionally minimal, serving only to mark the directory as a package. All actual functionality is presumably implemented in other modules within the package.

## Key Characteristics
- No imports or exports defined
- No package-level initialization logic
- Follows standard Python packaging conventions
