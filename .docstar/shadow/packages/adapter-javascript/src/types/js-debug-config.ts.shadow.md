## Primary Purpose
Type definition file providing a placeholder configuration type for JavaScript debugging functionality within the adapter-javascript package.

## Key Types
- **JsDebugConfig (L6)**: Generic configuration type defined as `Record<string, unknown>` - serves as a flexible placeholder for future debugging configuration schema

## Architecture Notes
- Uses TypeScript's `Record<string, unknown>` utility type to accept any key-value configuration object
- Marked as placeholder implementation with explicit comment indicating future refinement
- Part of the adapter-javascript package's type system for debugging capabilities

## Dependencies
- No external dependencies - uses only built-in TypeScript types

## Design Patterns
- Placeholder pattern: Establishes type contract while deferring implementation details
- Generic object typing using Record utility type for maximum flexibility
