## Primary Purpose
Type definition file providing a placeholder interface for JavaScript debugging configuration in the adapter-javascript package.

## Key Types
- **JsDebugConfig (L6)**: Generic placeholder type defined as `Record<string, unknown>` to accept any key-value pairs for debugging configuration

## Dependencies
- None (standalone type definition)

## Architectural Notes
- This is explicitly marked as a placeholder implementation to be refined in future development
- Uses TypeScript's `Record<string, unknown>` utility type for maximum flexibility
- Part of the adapter-javascript package, likely for IDE or debugging tool integration

## Current State
- Minimal implementation serving as scaffolding for future debug configuration features
- Provides type safety while allowing any configuration structure
