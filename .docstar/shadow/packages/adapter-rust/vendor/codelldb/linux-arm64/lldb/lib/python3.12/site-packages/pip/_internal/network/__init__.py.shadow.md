## Purpose
Module initialization file for pip's internal network utilities package. Contains only a module-level docstring indicating this package houses network-related functionality.

## Structure
- **Module docstring (L1-2)**: Brief description stating the package contains "purely network-related utilities"
- No classes, functions, or imports defined in this file

## Dependencies
None - this is a minimal package initialization file.

## Architectural Notes
This `__init__.py` file follows Python's standard package initialization pattern, serving as the entry point for the `pip._internal.network` package. The actual network utilities are likely implemented in other modules within this package directory.

## Key Characteristics
- Minimal initialization file with no executable code
- Part of pip's internal API structure (`pip._internal`)
- Suggests a modular approach to organizing network-related functionality
