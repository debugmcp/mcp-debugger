## Primary Purpose
This module provides a single entry point for obtaining the default CA certificate bundle path used by the requests library. It abstracts the certificate source selection between the standard certifi package and a custom standalone certificate bundle.

## Key Functions
- **where() (L18 or L20-21)**: Returns the path to the CA certificate bundle. Implementation varies based on environment:
  - Default: Delegates to `pip._vendor.certifi.where()` (L18)
  - Standalone mode: Returns path from `_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT` environment variable (L20-21)

## Environment-Based Configuration
The module uses conditional logic (L17-21) to determine certificate source:
- **Standard mode**: When `_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT` environment variable is not set, imports and uses certifi's `where()` function
- **Standalone mode**: When `_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT` is set, defines custom `where()` function that returns the environment variable value

## Dependencies
- **os**: Standard library module for environment variable access (L15)
- **pip._vendor.certifi**: Conditional import for standard certificate bundle location (L18)

## Architectural Pattern
Implements environment-based dependency injection pattern, allowing runtime selection of certificate bundle source without code changes. This enables packaging flexibility for different deployment scenarios (Linux distributions, managed environments).

## CLI Interface
Includes command-line interface (L23-24) that prints the current certificate bundle path when executed directly.

## Critical Invariants
- The `where()` function must always return a valid file path to a CA certificate bundle
- Environment variable `_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT` takes precedence over certifi when present
