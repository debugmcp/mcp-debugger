**Primary Purpose:** Package metadata file that defines the version identifier for the IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) library vendored within pip.

**Key Elements:**
- `__version__` (L1): String constant defining package version as '3.7', following semantic versioning convention

**Dependencies & Context:**
- Part of pip's vendored dependencies (`pip/_vendor/idna/`)
- Located in LLDB's Python environment for Rust adapter debugging tools
- Standard Python package metadata pattern for version identification

**Architectural Role:**
- Simple version declaration module, typically imported by package `__init__.py` or setup scripts
- Enables programmatic version checking and dependency resolution
- Single source of truth for package version within the IDNA library

**Usage Pattern:**
- Accessed via `from idna.package_data import __version__` or similar imports
- Used by package management tools and version compatibility checks
