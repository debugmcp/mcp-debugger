**Primary Purpose**: Type definitions module for the tomli TOML parser library, providing core type aliases used throughout the parser implementation.

**Key Type Definitions**:
- `ParseFloat` (L8): Callable type alias for float parsing functions, accepting a string and returning Any type
- `Key` (L9): Tuple type alias representing TOML key paths as sequences of strings (e.g., for nested keys like `table.subtable.key`)
- `Pos` (L10): Integer type alias representing character positions within TOML text during parsing

**Dependencies**:
- `typing` module: Uses `Any`, `Callable`, and `Tuple` for type annotations

**Architectural Role**: 
This is a foundational types module that establishes the type system contracts for the tomli parser. The types are designed to support:
- Pluggable float parsing strategies via `ParseFloat`
- Hierarchical key representation via `Key` tuples
- Position tracking for error reporting via `Pos`

**Usage Pattern**: These types are likely imported and used across other tomli modules for type hints, ensuring consistent type contracts throughout the TOML parsing implementation.
