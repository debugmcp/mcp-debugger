## Primary Purpose
Entry point module for the distro package when executed as a command-line script. This is a minimal launcher that delegates execution to the main function in the distro module.

## Key Components
- **Import statement (L1)**: Imports the `main` function from the relative `.distro` module
- **Script execution block (L3-4)**: Standard Python idiom that executes `main()` only when the module is run directly as a script, not when imported

## Dependencies
- Depends on `.distro` module which must contain a `main()` function
- Part of pip's vendored distro package for Linux distribution detection

## Architectural Pattern
Follows the common Python pattern of separating the main application logic from the script entry point. This allows the distro module to be both importable as a library and executable as a command-line tool.

## File Context
Located in pip's vendored dependencies, specifically the distro package for the linux-arm64 architecture. This suggests it's used for detecting Linux distribution information within pip's dependency management.
