**Primary Purpose**: Package initialization file for pip's internal models module, serving as the entry point for entity representation classes used throughout pip's dependency resolution and package management system.

**Architecture**: This is a minimal package marker file that establishes the `pip._internal.models` namespace. The package likely contains model classes representing core pip entities such as packages, versions, dependencies, and installation candidates.

**Key Elements**:
- Package docstring (L1-2): Defines the module's purpose as containing entity representation models

**Dependencies**: None in this file - actual model implementations are in sibling modules within the package.

**Usage Pattern**: Standard Python package initialization following pip's internal architecture where models are organized as a separate concern from business logic and I/O operations.

**Context**: Part of pip's internal API structure, located within a vendored codelldb distribution for Rust adapter tooling. This suggests it's used for debugging/development tooling rather than end-user pip functionality.
