**Primary Purpose:** Package initialization module for the `certifi` library, which provides Mozilla's Certificate Authority bundle for SSL/TLS certificate verification in Python applications.

**Key Exports:**
- `contents` (L1): Function imported from core module, likely returns certificate bundle data
- `where` (L1): Function imported from core module, likely returns path to certificate bundle file
- `__all__` (L3): Explicit public API declaration limiting exported symbols to `contents` and `where`
- `__version__` (L4): Version string "2024.02.02" indicating February 2024 release

**Dependencies:**
- `.core` module: Contains the actual implementation of certificate handling functionality

**Architectural Pattern:**
- Follows standard Python package initialization pattern with selective re-exports
- Uses explicit `__all__` declaration for clean public API surface
- Delegates core functionality to separate module while providing convenient top-level access

**Usage Context:**
This is a vendored copy of the `certifi` package within pip's vendor directory, used for SSL certificate verification during package downloads and installations. The module serves as the entry point for accessing Mozilla's trusted CA certificate bundle.
