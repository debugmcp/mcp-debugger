@generated: 2026-02-09T18:16:03Z

## Overall Purpose

The `compat` directory serves as a compatibility layer within pip's vendored resolvelib package, providing version-agnostic access to Python standard library components that have changed location or behavior across Python versions. This module ensures that resolvelib's dependency resolution functionality works consistently across different Python environments.

## Key Components and Architecture

**Package Structure:**
- `__init__.py` - Empty package marker that establishes `pip._vendor.resolvelib.compat` as an importable Python module
- `collections_abc.py` - Compatibility shim for abstract base classes (`Mapping` and `Sequence`)

**Compatibility Strategy:**
The directory implements a graceful degradation pattern using try/except ImportError blocks to handle Python version differences. This ensures backward compatibility while leveraging modern Python features when available.

## Public API Surface

**Main Entry Points:**
- `from pip._vendor.resolvelib.compat.collections_abc import Mapping, Sequence`

**Exported Functionality:**
- `Mapping` - Abstract base class for mapping types (dict-like objects)
- `Sequence` - Abstract base class for sequence types (list-like objects)

## Internal Organization

**Import Resolution Flow:**
1. Attempts to import from modern Python 3.3+ locations (`collections.abc`)
2. Falls back to legacy Python locations (`collections`) when modern imports fail
3. Re-exports through `__all__` to provide clean, consistent API

**Design Pattern:**
- **Version Abstraction**: Hides Python version differences from consuming code
- **Centralized Compatibility**: Consolidates all compatibility logic in dedicated module
- **Fail-Safe Imports**: Ensures functionality availability across Python versions

## Context and Integration

This compatibility layer is critical for pip's dependency resolver to function across diverse Python installations, particularly in embedded environments like the CodeLLDB adapter's ARM64 Linux distribution. It abstracts away standard library reorganization that occurred between Python 2.7 and 3.10+, ensuring resolvelib can operate consistently regardless of the host Python version.

The module follows pip's vendoring pattern, where third-party dependencies are included directly to avoid external dependency conflicts during package management operations.
