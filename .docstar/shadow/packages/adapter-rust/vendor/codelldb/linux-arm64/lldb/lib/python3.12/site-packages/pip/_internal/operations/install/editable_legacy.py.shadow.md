## Primary Purpose
Implements legacy editable package installation using the deprecated `setup.py develop` command. This module handles the older installation method for packages that need to be installed in development mode where changes to source code are immediately reflected without reinstallation.

## Key Functions

### install_editable (L15-47)
Core function that performs legacy editable installation using `setup.py develop`. Takes comprehensive installation parameters including:
- Installation location options (prefix, home, use_user_site)
- Build isolation settings
- Package metadata (name, setup_py_path)
- Build environment context

The function orchestrates the installation by:
1. Constructing setuptools develop arguments via `make_setuptools_develop_args` (L32-39)
2. Executing the installation within proper logging context and build environment (L41-47)
3. Running subprocess with `python setup.py develop` command

## Dependencies
- `BuildEnvironment`: Provides isolated build context management
- `make_setuptools_develop_args`: Utility for constructing setuptools command arguments
- `call_subprocess`: Subprocess execution with proper error handling
- `indent_log`: Logging context manager for nested output formatting

## Architectural Notes
- Uses keyword-only arguments pattern for clear parameter specification
- Implements proper context management with build environment and logging indentation
- Follows pip's internal pattern of separating argument construction from execution
- Part of pip's internal operations layer, specifically for legacy installation methods

## Critical Constraints
- Requires functional `setup.py` file in the package
- Depends on setuptools being available in the build environment
- Legacy method - newer installations should use PEP 517/518 build systems
- Installation occurs in the unpacked source directory context
