## Purpose
Package initialization module for pip's cachecontrol cache implementations. Serves as the main entry point for importing various cache backend classes used by the HTTP caching system.

## Key Components
- **FileCache import (L5)**: File-based cache implementation for storing HTTP responses on disk
- **SeparateBodyFileCache import (L5)**: Specialized file cache that stores response headers and bodies separately
- **RedisCache import (L6)**: Redis-based cache backend for distributed/shared caching scenarios

## Public API
- **__all__ (L8)**: Explicitly exports the three main cache classes, controlling what gets imported with `from cachecontrol.caches import *`

## Architecture
This is a standard Python package init file that consolidates cache backend implementations into a single import namespace. All cache classes implement a common interface expected by the cachecontrol library's main caching logic.

## Dependencies
- Imports from sibling modules within the same caches package
- Part of pip's vendored cachecontrol library structure
