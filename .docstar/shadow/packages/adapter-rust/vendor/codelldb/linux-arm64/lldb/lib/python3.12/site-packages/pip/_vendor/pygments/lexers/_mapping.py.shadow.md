## Purpose & Responsibility

Auto-generated lexer registry mapping for Pygments syntax highlighting library. Maps lexer class names to their module paths, display names, aliases, file patterns, and MIME types. This file serves as the central registry for all available language lexers in the Pygments package.

## Structure & Key Elements

**LEXERS Dictionary (L4-580)**: Single large dictionary mapping lexer class names to 5-tuple configurations:
- Module path (e.g., 'pip._vendor.pygments.lexers.python')
- Display name (e.g., 'Python')
- Aliases tuple (e.g., ('python', 'py', 'sage'))
- File patterns tuple (e.g., ('*.py', '*.pyw'))
- MIME types tuple (e.g., ('text/x-python', 'application/x-python'))

## Notable Patterns

- **Consistent Structure**: Every entry follows exact same 5-tuple format
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 575+ lexers covering programming languages, markup, config files, templates, etc.
- **Template Lexers**: Many entries for language combinations (e.g., 'HTML+Django', 'JavaScript+Ruby')
- **Legacy Support**: Includes multiple versions/variants (e.g., Python2Lexer, Python3Lexer)
- **File Association**: Strong mapping between file extensions and lexers for auto-detection

## Usage Context

This mapping file enables:
- Dynamic lexer discovery and loading
- File type auto-detection based on extensions/MIME types
- Lexer lookup by alias names
- Template language composition (base language + template engine)

## Dependencies

- Generated by `scripts/gen_mapfiles.py` (L1-2)
- Used by Pygments core for lexer registry and discovery
- Part of pip's vendored Pygments package for syntax highlighting in documentation/output
