## Purpose
Data model for generating installation reports that capture metadata about pip package installations in a structured JSON format. Part of pip's internal installation reporting system.

## Core Components

**InstallationReport class (L9-56)**
- Main report generator that converts installation requirements into structured dictionaries
- Constructor takes sequence of `InstallRequirement` objects (L10-11)
- Primary interface for creating installation reports with standardized format

**Key Methods:**

**_install_req_to_dict() (L14-40)** - Class method converting individual InstallRequirement to dictionary
- Extracts PEP 610 download information (L21)
- Records installation metadata: direct URL flag (L25), yanked status (L28), user-requested flag (L32)
- Includes PEP 566 metadata encoding (L35)
- Conditionally adds requested extras for top-level requirements (L37-39)
- Requires non-null download_info with assertion (L15)

**to_dict() (L42-56)** - Generates complete report dictionary
- Fixed version "1" for report format (L44)
- Includes pip version and environment markers (L45, L55)
- Processes all install requirements into list format (L46-48)

## Dependencies
- `InstallRequirement` from pip._internal.req.req_install - core requirement representation
- `default_environment` from packaging.markers - environment marker evaluation
- `__version__` from pip - version reporting

## Data Format Standards
- Follows PEP 610 for download URL JSON representation
- Implements PEP 566 metadata encoding
- Uses PEP 508 environment markers
- Conforms to PEP 376 "requested" field semantics

## Key Constraints
- InstallRequirement objects must have non-null download_info
- Report format version is hardcoded as "1"
- Environment markers use default environment (not override-aware)
