**Primary Purpose:**
Base resolver interface for pip's dependency resolution system. Defines the contract that all concrete resolvers must implement to handle package dependency resolution and installation ordering.

**Key Components:**

- **InstallRequirementProvider** (L6-8): Type alias for callable that takes a requirement name and optional InstallRequirement, returns InstallRequirement. Used to provide requirement objects during resolution.

- **BaseResolver** (L11-20): Abstract base class defining the resolver interface with two core methods:
  - `resolve()` (L12-15): Takes root requirements list and wheel compatibility flag, returns RequirementSet. Must be implemented by subclasses.
  - `get_installation_order()` (L17-20): Takes RequirementSet and returns ordered list of InstallRequirements for installation. Must be implemented by subclasses.

**Dependencies:**
- `InstallRequirement` from `pip._internal.req.req_install`: Represents individual package requirements
- `RequirementSet` from `pip._internal.req.req_set`: Container for resolved requirements

**Architectural Pattern:**
Abstract base class pattern providing interface definition without implementation. Ensures all concrete resolvers (legacy, resolvelib-based) implement the same contract for dependency resolution and installation ordering.

**Key Relationships:**
- Consumed by pip's installation pipeline
- Extended by concrete resolver implementations
- Works with RequirementSet as primary data structure for resolved dependencies
