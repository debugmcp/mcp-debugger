**Primary Purpose:** Provides custom logging infrastructure for pip's verbose output mode, extending Python's standard logging with a custom VERBOSE level between DEBUG and INFO.

**Key Components:**

- **VERBOSE constant (L13):** Custom log level set to 15, positioned between DEBUG (10) and INFO (20)
- **VerboseLogger class (L16-23):** Custom logger extending `logging.Logger` with `verbose()` method that logs at the VERBOSE level
- **getLogger() function (L26-28):** Wrapper around `logging.getLogger()` that ensures return type is cast to `VerboseLogger` for type safety
- **init_logging() function (L31-38):** Initialization function that registers the custom logger class and VERBOSE level name with Python's logging system

**Dependencies:**
- Python standard library: `logging`, `typing`
- Uses `cast()` from typing for type safety without runtime impact

**Architecture & Usage Pattern:**
- Must call `init_logging()` before any other modules use `logging.getLogger()` to ensure VerboseLogger is used globally
- Follows decorator pattern by extending standard logging functionality
- Type-safe design using `cast()` to maintain VerboseLogger interface while leveraging standard logging infrastructure

**Critical Constraints:**
- Initialization order dependency: `init_logging()` must be called in `pip._internal.__init__` before other modules initialize loggers
- VERBOSE level (15) is hardcoded between standard DEBUG and INFO levels
