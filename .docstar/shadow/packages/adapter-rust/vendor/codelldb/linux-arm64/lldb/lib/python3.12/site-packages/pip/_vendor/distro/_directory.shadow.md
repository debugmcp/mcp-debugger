## Overview
This directory contains the `distro` package - a Python library for detecting Linux distribution information. This is a vendored dependency within pip's codebase, providing reliable machine-readable distribution identification to replace Python's deprecated `platform.linux_distribution()` function.

## Architecture & Component Relationships
The package follows a clean separation of concerns with three core files:

- **`__init__.py`**: Public API facade that re-exports all functionality from the internal implementation
- **`distro.py`**: Core implementation containing all distribution detection logic and data source management
- **`__main__.py`**: Command-line entry point for script execution

The design uses a facade pattern where `__init__.py` provides a stable public interface while hiding internal module structure, allowing for refactoring without breaking API compatibility.

## Core Functionality
The package implements a multi-source fallback strategy for distribution detection:

1. **Primary data source**: `/etc/os-release` files (modern standard)
2. **Secondary sources**: `lsb_release` command, distro-specific release files
3. **Fallback sources**: `uname` command, AIX `oslevel` command

All detection logic is encapsulated in the `LinuxDistribution` class, with a module-level singleton (`_distro`) that backs the global convenience functions.

## Public API Surface
The package exposes a comprehensive API through `__init__.py`:

### Core Distribution Information
- `id()`, `name()`, `version()`, `codename()` - Basic distribution attributes
- `info()` - Complete distribution information as structured dict
- `version_parts()`, `major_version()`, `minor_version()`, `build_number()` - Version components

### Data Source Access
- `os_release_info()`, `lsb_release_info()`, `distro_release_info()`, `uname_info()` - Raw data from each source
- Attribute accessors for granular data retrieval

### Legacy Compatibility
- `linux_distribution()` - Drop-in replacement for deprecated platform function

### Constants & Normalization
- `NORMALIZED_DISTRO_ID`, `NORMALIZED_LSB_ID`, `NORMALIZED_OS_ID` - ID normalization tables

## Key Design Features
- **Reliability**: Multi-source fallback ensures detection works across diverse Linux distributions
- **Performance**: Cached properties prevent repeated file/command operations
- **Flexibility**: Supports custom root directories for chroot environments
- **Normalization**: Built-in ID and name normalization for consistent results
- **Dual Interface**: Works as both importable library and command-line tool

## Data Flow
1. Distribution queries flow through the public API to the singleton `LinuxDistribution` instance
2. The class attempts data sources in priority order, caching results
3. Normalization tables ensure consistent IDs across different sources
4. Version parsing algorithms handle various format inconsistencies
5. Fallback mechanisms provide graceful degradation when primary sources fail

This package is essential infrastructure for pip's platform detection capabilities, enabling accurate identification of Linux distributions for dependency resolution and platform-specific operations.
