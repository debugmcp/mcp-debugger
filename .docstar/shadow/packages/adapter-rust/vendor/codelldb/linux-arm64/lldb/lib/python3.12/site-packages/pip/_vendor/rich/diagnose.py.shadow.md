## Primary Purpose
Debug utility module for Rich library that generates comprehensive system diagnostics reports. Provides a standalone tool to troubleshoot Rich console rendering issues by collecting environment variables, platform information, and console features.

## Key Components

### `report()` (L10-34)
Main diagnostic function that prints debugging information to console:
- Creates Console instance and inspects its properties using Rich's inspect utility
- Queries Windows console features via `get_windows_console_features()`
- Collects 9 key environment variables related to terminal/console behavior:
  - Terminal identification: `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM`
  - Color control: `CLICOLOR`, `NO_COLOR`
  - Dimensions: `COLUMNS`, `LINES`, `JUPYTER_COLUMNS`, `JUPYTER_LINES`
  - Runtime context: `JPY_PARENT_PID`, `VSCODE_VERBOSE_LOGGING`
- Displays environment variables in formatted panel
- Shows platform system information

### Main Execution (L36-37)
Direct script execution entry point that calls `report()` when module is run standalone.

## Dependencies
- `os`: Environment variable access
- `platform`: System information
- `pip._vendor.rich.inspect`: Object introspection utility
- `pip._vendor.rich.console`: Core console functionality and Windows feature detection
- `pip._vendor.rich.panel`: UI panel formatting
- `pip._vendor.rich.pretty`: Pretty-printing objects

## Architectural Notes
- Designed as both importable module and standalone diagnostic script
- Focuses on environment variables that commonly affect terminal rendering behavior
- Uses Rich's own formatting capabilities to display diagnostic information
- Pragma no cover indicates this is primarily for manual debugging, not automated testing
