**Primary Purpose**: Empty Python package initializer file that serves as a module marker for the pip internal utilities package.

**File Structure**: This is an empty `__init__.py` file with no content, indicating it exists solely to make the `pip/_internal/utils/` directory recognizable as a Python package.

**Architectural Role**: Acts as the package boundary for pip's internal utility modules, allowing imports like `from pip._internal.utils import <submodule>`. The empty implementation suggests this package serves as a namespace container rather than providing direct functionality.

**Dependencies**: None - completely empty file with no imports or code.

**Key Characteristics**:
- No classes, functions, or variables defined
- No module-level documentation or comments
- Minimal footprint implementation typical of utility package organizers
- Enables submodule imports within the pip internal utilities namespace
