## Primary Purpose
Version definition file for urllib3 library - provides a single source of truth for the package version string.

## Key Elements
- `__version__` (L2): String constant defining urllib3 version "1.26.18"

## Dependencies
None - standalone version definition module.

## Architectural Notes
- Protected via CODEOWNERS (L1) indicating this file requires approval for changes
- Follows standard Python packaging convention of defining `__version__` in a separate module
- Version string follows semantic versioning format (major.minor.patch)
- Likely imported by setup.py and __init__.py for consistent version reporting

## Usage Pattern
Typically imported as `from ._version import __version__` by the main package to expose version information to users and build tools.
