**Purpose**: Package initializer for pip's legacy dependency resolution module.

**Architecture**: This is an empty `__init__.py` file that serves as a Python package marker for the legacy resolution system within pip's internal structure. It makes the `legacy` directory importable as a Python module.

**Context**: Located within pip's internal resolution system (`pip/_internal/resolution/`), this package likely contains the older dependency resolution algorithm that was used before pip's newer resolver was implemented.

**Dependencies**: None directly - serves as package entry point.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Empty file with no executable code
- Standard Python package initialization pattern
- Part of pip's internal API (not intended for external use)
- Legacy resolution system suggests this may be deprecated or maintained for backwards compatibility
