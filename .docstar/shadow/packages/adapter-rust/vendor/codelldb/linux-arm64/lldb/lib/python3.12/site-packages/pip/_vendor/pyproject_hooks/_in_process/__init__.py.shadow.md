## Purpose and Responsibility

This `__init__.py` file creates a minimal subpackage for pyproject-hooks' in-process execution environment. Its primary purpose is to provide a clean namespace that won't interfere with backend module imports while offering a compatibility layer for accessing the `_in_process.py` script across Python versions.

## Key Functions

- **`_in_proc_script_path()` (L13-14, L16-18)**: Returns a context manager for accessing the `_in_process.py` script file. Two implementations exist for Python version compatibility:
  - Legacy implementation (L13-14) uses `resources.path()` for Python 3.8
  - Modern implementation (L16-18) uses `resources.as_file()` with `resources.files()` for Python 3.9+

## Dependencies

- **`importlib.resources`** (L7): Used for resource file access, with feature detection to determine available API

## Architectural Decisions

- **Minimal subpackage design**: Deliberately keeps the namespace empty to prevent module shadowing issues when backends import modules
- **Python version compatibility**: Uses try/except AttributeError pattern (L9-18) to detect `resources.files` availability and provide appropriate fallback
- **Context manager pattern**: Both implementations return context managers for proper resource cleanup

## Critical Constraints

- Must remain minimal to avoid interfering with backend module imports
- The directory containing this file is added to `sys.path` for `_in_process.py` execution
- Requires `_in_process.py` to exist in the same package directory
