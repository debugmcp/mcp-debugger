## Overall Purpose
This directory contains pip's core package installation operations, providing the low-level machinery for installing Python packages from different sources. It handles both modern wheel-based installations and legacy editable installations using `setup.py develop`.

## Key Components and Relationships

### Package Structure
- **`__init__.py`**: Entry point module that establishes the namespace for installation operations
- **`wheel.py`**: Complete wheel installation implementation - the primary installation pathway for modern Python packages
- **`editable_legacy.py`**: Legacy editable installation support using deprecated `setup.py develop` command

### Component Integration
The modules work in a layered architecture:
- `wheel.py` handles the majority of package installations via the wheel format
- `editable_legacy.py` provides fallback support for development installations of packages without modern build systems
- Both modules integrate with pip's broader build environment and subprocess management systems

## Public API Surface

### Primary Entry Points
- **`install_wheel()`** (wheel.py): Main interface for installing wheel packages
- **`install_editable()`** (editable_legacy.py): Interface for legacy editable installations

### Core Installation Flow
1. **Wheel Installation Path**: Parse wheel metadata → extract files → generate scripts → compile bytecode → update RECORD files
2. **Legacy Editable Path**: Construct setuptools arguments → execute `setup.py develop` in build environment

## Internal Organization and Data Flow

### Wheel Installation Architecture
- **File Abstraction**: Protocol-based `File` interface with concrete implementations (`ZipBackedFile`, `ScriptFile`)
- **Path Management**: Bidirectional path conversion between filesystem and RECORD format
- **Script Generation**: Entry point processing with special handling for pip/setuptools versioning
- **Metadata Management**: INSTALLER, RECORD, and REQUESTED file creation and maintenance

### Critical Data Flow
1. Wheel metadata parsing and directory determination
2. File partitioning (root scheme vs data scheme)
3. Atomic file extraction with path traversal protection
4. Entry point script generation and PATH validation
5. Python bytecode compilation
6. Installation record finalization

## Important Patterns and Conventions

### Design Patterns
- **Protocol-based abstractions**: File interface allows different file source handling
- **Context management**: Proper build environment and logging context usage
- **Atomic operations**: Temporary file usage with atomic replace semantics
- **Security-first**: Path traversal validation for all extracted files

### Integration Points
- Build environment management for isolated installations
- Subprocess execution with proper error handling and logging
- Integration with pip's metadata system and distribution management
- Cross-platform path handling and permission management

### Special Handling
- Version-aware script generation respecting `ENSUREPIP_OPTIONS`
- Legacy fallback mechanisms for packages without modern build systems
- Console script PATH validation and user warnings
- Proper shebang replacement for cross-platform script execution

This directory represents pip's core installation engine, abstracting the complexities of Python package installation while maintaining compatibility with both modern and legacy package formats.
