**Purpose**: Empty Python package initialization file for pip's vendored urllib3 packages module.

**File Structure**: This is a standard `__init__.py` file that serves as a package marker, making the `packages` directory recognizable as a Python package within the pip._vendor.urllib3 namespace hierarchy.

**Functionality**: 
- Contains no executable code or imports
- Establishes the `pip._vendor.urllib3.packages` namespace
- Likely intended to contain subpackages or modules related to urllib3's bundled dependencies

**Context**: Located within pip's vendored copy of urllib3, suggesting this directory may house third-party packages that urllib3 depends on but vendors internally to avoid dependency conflicts.

**Dependencies**: None - completely empty file.

**Architectural Role**: Serves as a namespace container in the urllib3 package structure, following standard Python packaging conventions for creating importable package hierarchies.
