## Purpose
Provides reporting infrastructure for pip's dependency resolution process via resolvelib. Implements two reporter classes that track and log resolution events, particularly candidate rejections and backtracking warnings.

## Key Classes and Functions

### PipReporter (L12-56)
Primary reporter for production use that monitors dependency resolution progress and provides user feedback.

**Key attributes:**
- `reject_count_by_package` (L14): DefaultDict tracking rejection counts per package name
- `_messages_at_reject_count` (L16-33): Static mapping of rejection thresholds to user-facing warning messages

**Key methods:**
- `rejecting_candidate(criterion, candidate)` (L35-55): Core functionality that increments rejection counts and displays progressive warnings at specific thresholds (1, 8, 13 rejections)

**Warning thresholds:**
- 1 rejection: Initial backtracking notification
- 8 rejections: Persistence warning 
- 13 rejections: Performance advisory with link to backtracking guidance

### PipDebuggingReporter (L58-80)
Development/debugging reporter that logs all resolution events at info level.

**Methods:**
- `starting()` (L61-62): Logs resolution start
- `starting_round(index)` (L64-65): Logs round initiation
- `ending_round(index, state)` (L67-68): Logs round completion
- `ending(state)` (L70-71): Logs resolution completion
- `adding_requirement(requirement, parent)` (L73-74): Logs requirement additions
- `rejecting_candidate(criterion, candidate)` (L76-77): Logs candidate rejections
- `pinning(candidate)` (L79-80): Logs candidate selections

## Dependencies
- `pip._vendor.resolvelib.reporters.BaseReporter`: Base class for reporter implementations
- `.base.Candidate, Requirement`: Local type definitions for resolution entities
- Standard library: `collections.defaultdict`, `logging`, `typing`

## Architecture Notes
- Implements observer pattern for resolution events
- PipReporter focuses on user experience with threshold-based warnings
- PipDebuggingReporter provides comprehensive event tracing
- Both extend resolvelib's BaseReporter interface
- Logging uses module-level logger (L9) for consistent log formatting
