**Purpose**: Implements the Requests library's hook system for intercepting and modifying HTTP request/response lifecycle events.

**Key Components**:
- `HOOKS` (L12): Global list defining supported hook events, currently only contains "response"
- `default_hooks()` (L15-16): Factory function returning empty hook registry dictionary with each hook type mapped to empty list
- `dispatch_hook()` (L22-33): Core hook dispatcher that executes registered hook functions and chains their return values

**Hook Execution Flow**:
1. Accepts hook key, hooks dictionary, and data to be processed
2. Retrieves hook list for the given key (L25)
3. Normalizes single callable to list format (L27-28)
4. Executes each hook function sequentially, passing hook_data and kwargs (L29-32)
5. Chains hook results: if hook returns non-None value, it replaces hook_data for subsequent hooks
6. Returns final processed hook_data

**Architecture Notes**:
- Hook functions can modify data by returning new value or pass-through by returning None
- Supports both single callable and list of callables for each hook type
- Currently limited to "response" hooks but designed for extensibility
- Part of larger Requests library's plugin/middleware system

**Dependencies**: None (standalone utility module)
