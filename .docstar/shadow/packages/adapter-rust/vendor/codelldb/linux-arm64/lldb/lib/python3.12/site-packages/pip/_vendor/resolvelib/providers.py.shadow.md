## Primary Purpose
This file defines abstract base classes for the resolvelib dependency resolution library, providing the required interface contracts for dependency resolution providers and resolvers.

## Core Classes

### AbstractProvider (L1-110)
Abstract delegate class that defines the interface for providing dependency resolution logic. All methods raise `NotImplementedError` and must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

**Key Methods:**
- `identify()` (L4-10): Maps requirements/candidates to unique identifiers for grouping and comparison
- `get_preference()` (L12-61): Returns sort keys for requirement resolution ordering - lower values indicate higher priority
- `find_matches()` (L63-90): Discovers all viable candidates satisfying given constraints and incompatibilities
- `is_satisfied_by()` (L92-101): Validates whether a candidate satisfies a specific requirement
- `get_dependencies()` (L103-109): Extracts dependency requirements from a candidate

### AbstractResolver (L112-133)
Abstract base class for the core resolution engine that orchestrates the dependency resolution process.

**Key Elements:**
- `base_exception` (L115): Class attribute defining the exception type for resolution failures
- `__init__()` (L117-119): Initializes with provider and reporter dependencies
- `resolve()` (L121-133): Main resolution method that takes constraints and returns resolution state with a `mapping` attribute

## Architecture Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: AbstractProvider allows plugging different resolution strategies
- **Template Method**: Abstract classes define the resolution workflow structure
- **Dependency Injection**: Resolver accepts provider and reporter as constructor dependencies

## Key Relationships
- Resolver depends on Provider for domain-specific resolution logic
- Provider methods work together: `identify()` → `find_matches()` → `is_satisfied_by()` → `get_dependencies()`
- Resolution flow involves preference-based ordering and constraint satisfaction

## Critical Contracts
- Provider methods must handle requirement information as named tuples with `requirement` and `parent` fields
- `find_matches()` return value must be ordered by preference (most preferred first)
- Resolution result must contain a `mapping` attribute with identifier→candidate pairs
- All abstract methods raise `NotImplementedError` when not overridden
