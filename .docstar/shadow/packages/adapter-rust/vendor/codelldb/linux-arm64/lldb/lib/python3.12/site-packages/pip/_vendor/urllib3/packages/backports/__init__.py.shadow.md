## Purpose
Empty module file serving as a package marker for the `backports` namespace within pip's vendored urllib3 distribution. This file enables the `backports` directory to be recognized as a Python package.

## Structure
- No classes, functions, or executable code
- Serves solely as a package initialization marker
- Part of pip's vendored dependencies hierarchy: `pip._vendor.urllib3.packages.backports`

## Dependencies
None - this is an empty `__init__.py` file

## Architectural Role
Acts as a namespace package marker in the urllib3 backports system, likely intended to house Python 2/3 compatibility shims or backported functionality from newer Python versions. The empty nature suggests either:
1. All backport functionality is implemented in submodules
2. The package structure is prepared but not yet populated
3. This is a minimal package marker for import path resolution

## Critical Notes
- File is completely empty - no initialization code or imports
- Any functionality would be in sibling modules within the backports package
- Modifications to this file should maintain its role as a simple package marker
