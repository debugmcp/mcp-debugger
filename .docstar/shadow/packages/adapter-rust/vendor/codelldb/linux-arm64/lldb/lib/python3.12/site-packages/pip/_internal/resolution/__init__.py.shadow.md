**Primary Purpose**: Empty package initializer for pip's internal resolution module. This file marks the `pip/_internal/resolution/` directory as a Python package, enabling imports of resolution-related components.

**Package Structure**: Located within pip's internal architecture at `packages/adapter-rust/vendor/codelldb/linux-arm64/lldb/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_internal/resolution/`, this appears to be part of a vendored pip installation bundled with the CodeLLDB debugger extension for Rust development on ARM64 Linux systems.

**Functionality**: Contains no executable code - serves purely as a package marker. The resolution module likely contains dependency resolution logic, solver algorithms, and package conflict resolution mechanisms used by pip's installation process.

**Dependencies**: None - this is a minimal package initializer.

**Architectural Role**: Part of pip's modular internal structure, separating resolution logic from other internal components like download, install, and cache management. The empty `__init__.py` pattern suggests submodules handle the actual resolution functionality.
