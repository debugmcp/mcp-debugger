**Primary Purpose**: Empty module initialization file for the urllib3 SecureTransport contrib package.

**Core Functionality**: This is an empty `__init__.py` file that serves as a Python package marker for the `_securetransport` module within urllib3's contrib system. The SecureTransport integration likely provides SSL/TLS functionality using macOS's native SecureTransport framework as an alternative to OpenSSL.

**Architecture**: 
- Part of urllib3's pluggable SSL backend system under `contrib/`
- The `_securetransport` package structure suggests this is an internal implementation detail
- Empty initialization indicates the actual implementation resides in other modules within this package

**Dependencies**: None explicitly defined in this file.

**Key Patterns**:
- Standard Python package initialization pattern
- Follows urllib3's contrib module organization for optional SSL backends
- Underscored naming convention indicates internal/private API

**Usage Context**: This module would typically be imported indirectly when urllib3 detects and configures SecureTransport as the SSL backend on macOS systems. The empty init suggests the package's public interface is exposed through submodules.
