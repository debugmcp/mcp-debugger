## Purpose
Defines standardized exit status codes for pip CLI operations, providing consistent error reporting across the pip package manager.

## Key Constants
- `SUCCESS` (L1): Standard success exit code (0)
- `ERROR` (L2): Generic error exit code (1) 
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` (L3): Unidentified error condition (2)
- `VIRTUALENV_NOT_FOUND` (L4): Virtual environment resolution failure (3)
- `PREVIOUS_BUILD_DIR_ERROR` (L5): Build directory cleanup/access issues (4)
- `NO_MATCHES_FOUND` (L6): Package search yielded no results (23)

## Usage Pattern
This module serves as a centralized registry of exit codes that pip commands return to the shell. The codes follow Unix conventions where 0 indicates success and non-zero values indicate various failure modes. The specific numeric values allow calling processes to distinguish between different types of failures programmatically.

## Dependencies
None - this is a pure constants module with no imports.

## Architectural Notes
- Uses module-level constants rather than an enum or class structure
- Exit code 23 for NO_MATCHES_FOUND suggests it may align with specific shell scripting conventions
- Provides a contract between pip's internal error handling and external process monitoring
