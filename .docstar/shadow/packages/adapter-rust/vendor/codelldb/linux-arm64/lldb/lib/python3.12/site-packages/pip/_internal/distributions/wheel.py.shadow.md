## WheelDistribution - Pip Wheel Package Handler

**Primary Purpose:** Concrete implementation of AbstractDistribution for handling pre-built wheel packages in pip. Wheels require no build preparation since they are already compiled and packaged.

**Key Components:**

- **WheelDistribution class (L16-42):** Main distribution handler for wheel files
  - Inherits from AbstractDistribution providing the standard distribution interface
  - Represents packages that are already built and ready for installation
  - No build preparation required unlike source distributions

**Core Methods:**

- **build_tracker_id property (L23-24):** Returns None since wheels don't need build tracking
- **get_metadata_distribution() (L26-34):** Extracts metadata from wheel file
  - Creates FilesystemWheel wrapper around local wheel file
  - Returns BaseDistribution containing the wheel's metadata
  - Uses canonicalized package name for consistency
  - Asserts wheel has local file path and name (L31-32)
- **prepare_distribution_metadata() (L36-42):** No-op since wheels need no preparation
  - Required by AbstractDistribution interface but does nothing
  - Parameters ignored: finder, build_isolation, check_build_deps

**Dependencies:**
- pip._vendor.packaging.utils for name canonicalization
- pip._internal.distributions.base.AbstractDistribution as base class
- pip._internal.metadata for wheel handling (BaseDistribution, FilesystemWheel, get_wheel_distribution)

**Architectural Pattern:** 
- Part of pip's distribution abstraction layer where different package types (wheel, sdist, installed) implement common interface
- Strategy pattern implementation for handling wheel-specific distribution logic
- Minimal implementation since wheels are pre-processed packages
