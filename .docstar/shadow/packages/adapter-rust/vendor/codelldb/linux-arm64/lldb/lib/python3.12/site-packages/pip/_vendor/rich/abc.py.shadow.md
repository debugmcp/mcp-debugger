## Primary Purpose
Defines the abstract base class for Rich's renderable protocol, enabling type checking for objects that can be rendered by Rich's console printing system.

## Key Classes and Functions

**RichRenderable (L4-18)** - Abstract base class implementing Rich's renderable protocol
- Uses `__subclasshook__` (L16-18) to define duck typing rules
- Checks for presence of `__rich_console__` or `__rich__` methods to determine renderability
- Designed for `isinstance()` checks rather than inheritance

## Dependencies
- `abc.ABC` - Standard library abstract base class foundation
- `pip._vendor.rich.text.Text` - Used in test code demonstration

## Architectural Patterns
- **Protocol-based design**: Uses duck typing via `__subclasshook__` rather than requiring explicit inheritance
- **Type checking interface**: Primarily serves as a type guard for Rich-compatible objects
- **Minimal API**: Single method focuses solely on protocol detection

## Key Implementation Details
The `__subclasshook__` method (L16-18) implements Rich's core renderability contract:
- Objects with `__rich_console__` method (full Rich protocol)
- Objects with `__rich__` method (simplified Rich protocol)
- Returns `True` if either method exists, enabling `isinstance(obj, RichRenderable)` checks

## Usage Context
Part of Rich's type system for console rendering - allows library consumers to check if arbitrary objects can be printed via Rich's console system before attempting rendering operations.
