@generated: 2026-02-09T18:16:17Z

## Overall Purpose

The `distlib` package is a comprehensive Python distribution utilities library that provides a complete toolkit for managing Python packages throughout their lifecycle - from discovery and download to installation and dependency resolution. This is a vendored copy within pip's dependency chain, specifically for ARM64 Linux systems in a Rust adapter context, enabling cross-language toolchain integration.

## Core Architecture

The package implements a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Foundation Layer** (`__init__.py`, `compat.py`, `util.py`):
- Base exception handling, logging infrastructure, and version management
- Extensive Python 2/3 compatibility layer with backports for missing functionality
- Rich utility library providing requirement parsing, file operations, caching, networking, and platform detection

**Metadata & Standards Layer** (`metadata.py`, `version.py`, `markers.py`):
- Multi-format metadata parsing supporting PEP 1.0-2.2 standards with automatic version detection
- Flexible version parsing supporting PEP-440, legacy setuptools, and semantic versioning schemes
- PEP 508 environment marker evaluation for conditional dependencies

**Package Discovery & Resolution** (`locators.py`, `database.py`):
- Multiple locator strategies (PyPI JSON/RPC, HTML scraping, local directories, aggregated sources)
- PEP 376 compliant package database with dependency graph analysis and topological sorting
- Thread-safe multi-source package discovery with caching and URL scoring

**Distribution Formats** (`wheel.py`, `scripts.py`, `resources.py`):
- Complete wheel (PEP 427) support with building, installation, verification, and mounting
- Cross-platform script generation with Windows launcher integration and Unix shebang optimization  
- Unified resource access abstraction for files within packages (filesystem or zip-based)

**Packaging Operations** (`index.py`, `manifest.py`):
- Full PyPI client with upload, registration, GPG signing, and documentation publishing
- MANIFEST.in-style file filtering system with glob patterns and distutils compatibility

## Key Entry Points & Public API

**Package Discovery**:
- `locators.locate()` - Default package locator using PyPI scraping
- `database.DistributionPath()` - Manage installed package databases
- `database.get_distribution()` - Find specific installed packages

**Metadata Handling**:
- `metadata.Metadata()` - Universal metadata parser with format auto-detection
- `version.get_scheme()` - Access versioning schemes (PEP-440, legacy, semantic)
- `markers.interpret()` - Evaluate PEP 508 environment markers

**Package Operations**:
- `wheel.Wheel()` - Build, install, verify, and manipulate wheel distributions
- `index.PackageIndex()` - Upload packages and interact with PyPI
- `scripts.ScriptMaker()` - Generate cross-platform executable scripts

**Resource Management**:
- `resources.finder()` - Access package resources (files, data)
- `util.FileOperator()` - Transactional file operations with rollback

## Integration Patterns

The components work together through several key integration patterns:

1. **Unified Metadata Pipeline**: `metadata.Metadata` serves as the central hub, consumed by `wheel`, `database`, and `index` components for consistent package information handling

2. **Pluggable Locator System**: `locators` provides a strategy pattern allowing `database` and other consumers to discover packages from multiple sources transparently

3. **Version Scheme Abstraction**: `version` module provides pluggable version comparison used throughout `database`, `locators`, and `metadata` for consistent version handling

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: `compat` and `util` provide foundational services used by all other modules, ensuring consistent behavior across Python versions and platforms

5. **Resource Abstraction**: `resources` enables `wheel`, `scripts`, and other components to access package contents uniformly regardless of storage format

## Dependencies & Context

The package has minimal external dependencies, relying primarily on Python standard library modules with careful compatibility handling. As a vendored dependency within pip's ecosystem, it provides the core packaging infrastructure that pip itself relies upon, demonstrating its maturity and reliability for production use in Python's primary package management tool.
