## Primary Purpose
Exception hierarchy for the msgpack library, defining specialized error types for unpacking and packing operations with msgpack format data.

## Key Classes and Functions

**UnpackException (L1-7)**: Base exception class for msgpack unpacking errors. Serves as parent for specific unpacking error types. Important note: not all unpack errors inherit from this base - some may be standard Python exceptions.

**BufferFull (L10-11)**: Empty subclass of UnpackException indicating buffer capacity issues during unpacking.

**OutOfData (L14-15)**: Empty subclass of UnpackException indicating insufficient data available for unpacking operation.

**FormatError (L18-19)**: Multiple inheritance from ValueError and UnpackException. Indicates invalid msgpack format encountered during unpacking.

**StackError (L22-23)**: Multiple inheritance from ValueError and UnpackException. Indicates excessive nesting depth in msgpack data structure.

**ExtraData (L30-43)**: Specialized exception for one-shot unpacking operations when trailing data remains after successful unpacking. Stores both the successfully unpacked data (`unpacked` attribute) and the remaining extra data (`extra` attribute). Custom `__str__` method provides descriptive error message.

## Deprecated Aliases

**UnpackValueError (L27)**: Deprecated alias pointing to built-in ValueError
**PackException (L46)**: Deprecated alias pointing to built-in Exception  
**PackValueError (L47)**: Deprecated alias pointing to built-in ValueError
**PackOverflowError (L48)**: Deprecated alias pointing to built-in OverflowError

## Architecture Notes

- Uses multiple inheritance pattern for FormatError and StackError to maintain compatibility with both ValueError and the msgpack exception hierarchy
- ExtraData provides structured access to both successful and problematic data portions
- Maintains backward compatibility through deprecated aliases while encouraging migration to standard Python exceptions
- Clear separation between unpacking-specific exceptions and general-purpose aliases
