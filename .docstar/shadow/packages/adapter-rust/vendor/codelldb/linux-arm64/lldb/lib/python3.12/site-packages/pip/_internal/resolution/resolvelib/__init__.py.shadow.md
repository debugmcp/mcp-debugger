## Purpose
Empty Python package initialization file for pip's resolvelib resolution module. This file serves as a package marker to make the `resolution/resolvelib` directory a valid Python package that can be imported.

## Key Elements
- **Package Structure**: Defines `pip._internal.resolution.resolvelib` as an importable package
- **No Implementation**: Contains no actual code, classes, or functions
- **Integration Point**: Enables the resolvelib-based dependency resolution system to be organized as a proper Python package

## Architecture Context
Part of pip's internal dependency resolution system that uses the external `resolvelib` library. This init file allows the resolution logic to be modularized and imported cleanly from other parts of pip's codebase.

## Dependencies
None directly - serves as organizational structure for the resolvelib integration components.

## Usage Pattern
Imported implicitly when accessing submodules like `pip._internal.resolution.resolvelib.resolver` or other resolvelib adapter components.
