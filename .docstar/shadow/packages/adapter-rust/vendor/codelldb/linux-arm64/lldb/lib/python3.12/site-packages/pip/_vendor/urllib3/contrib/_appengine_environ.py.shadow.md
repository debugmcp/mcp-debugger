## Purpose
Environment detection utility for Google App Engine deployments. Provides boolean functions to identify different App Engine runtime contexts and generations.

## Key Functions
- `is_appengine()` (L8-9): Master detection function that returns True if running in any App Engine environment (local or production)
- `is_local_appengine()` (L22-25): Detects local development server by checking for "Development/" prefix in SERVER_SOFTWARE
- `is_prod_appengine()` (L28-31): Detects production App Engine by checking for "Google App Engine/" prefix in SERVER_SOFTWARE  
- `is_appengine_sandbox()` (L12-19): Identifies first-generation restrictive sandbox (python27 runtime only)
- `is_prod_appengine_mvms()` (L34-36): Deprecated function that always returns False

## Dependencies
- `os`: Used for environment variable access via `os.environ`

## Detection Logic
All detection relies on two environment variables:
- `APPENGINE_RUNTIME`: Present in all App Engine environments
- `SERVER_SOFTWARE`: Distinguishes between local development ("Development/") and production ("Google App Engine/")

## Architectural Notes
- Simple boolean detection pattern with no state or configuration
- Backward compatibility maintained through deprecated `is_prod_appengine_mvms()` 
- First-generation sandbox detection hardcoded to python27 runtime only
- No error handling for missing environment variables (may raise KeyError)
