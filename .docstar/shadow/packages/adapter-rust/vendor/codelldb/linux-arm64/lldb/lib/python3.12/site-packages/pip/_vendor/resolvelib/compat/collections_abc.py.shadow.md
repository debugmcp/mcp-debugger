**Primary Purpose:** Compatibility shim module that provides consistent access to `Mapping` and `Sequence` abstract base classes across different Python versions.

**Core Functionality:**
- Exports `Mapping` and `Sequence` classes via `__all__` (L1)
- Implements fallback import strategy (L3-6):
  - Primary: attempts import from `collections.abc` (modern Python 3.3+)
  - Fallback: imports from `collections` (legacy Python versions)

**Dependencies:**
- `collections.abc` (preferred, modern location)
- `collections` (fallback for older Python versions)

**Architectural Pattern:**
- **Compatibility Layer**: Abstracts Python version differences in standard library organization
- **Graceful Degradation**: Uses try/except ImportError pattern for version compatibility
- **Clean API**: Re-exports classes through `__all__` to maintain consistent interface

**Context:**
This module is part of pip's vendored resolvelib package, ensuring the dependency resolver works across different Python environments. The collections.abc module was introduced in Python 3.3, with items moved from collections to collections.abc in Python 3.10 (with deprecation warnings in between).

**Key Invariant:** Always provides access to `Mapping` and `Sequence` abstract base classes regardless of Python version.
