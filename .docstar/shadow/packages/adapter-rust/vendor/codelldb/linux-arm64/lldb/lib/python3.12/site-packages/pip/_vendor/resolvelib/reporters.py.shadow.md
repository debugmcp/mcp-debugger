## BaseReporter Interface for Resolution Progress Tracking

**Purpose**: Abstract base class defining the callback interface for monitoring dependency resolution progress in pip's resolvelib package.

**Core Architecture**:
- `BaseReporter` (L1-43): Abstract delegate class providing hooks for resolution lifecycle events
- All methods are no-op stubs meant to be overridden by concrete implementations
- Follows observer pattern to decouple resolution logic from progress reporting

**Key Lifecycle Methods**:
- `starting()` (L4-5): Pre-resolution initialization hook
- `starting_round(index)` (L7-11): Called at beginning of each resolution round (zero-based indexing)
- `ending_round(index, state)` (L13-18): Called at end of each round (NOT for final round)
- `ending(state)` (L20-21): Called upon successful resolution completion

**Requirement Management Hooks**:
- `adding_requirement(requirement, parent)` (L23-31): Tracks new requirement additions
  - `requirement`: The constraint being added
  - `parent`: The candidate requiring this dependency (None for root requirements)

**Conflict Resolution Tracking**:
- `resolving_conflicts(causes)` (L33-37): Called when backtracking begins due to conflicts
- `rejecting_candidate(criterion, candidate)` (L39-40): Tracks candidate rejections during backtracking
- `pinning(candidate)` (L42-43): Records candidates added to the solution

**Usage Pattern**: Implementations should subclass and override relevant methods to provide custom progress reporting, logging, or UI updates during dependency resolution.
