## Purpose
Implements `InstalledDistribution` class for representing packages that are already installed on the system, requiring no preparation or metadata computation.

## Key Components
- **InstalledDistribution (L8-29)**: Concrete implementation of `AbstractDistribution` for already-installed packages
  - Inherits from `pip._internal.distributions.base.AbstractDistribution`
  - Represents packages where metadata and installation status are already resolved

## Core Methods
- **build_tracker_id property (L15-17)**: Always returns `None` since installed distributions don't need build tracking
- **get_metadata_distribution() (L19-21)**: Returns the `BaseDistribution` object from `self.req.satisfied_by` with assertion that package is actually installed
- **prepare_distribution_metadata() (L23-29)**: No-op implementation since installed packages don't require metadata preparation

## Dependencies
- `AbstractDistribution` from `pip._internal.distributions.base` - base class
- `PackageFinder` from `pip._internal.index.package_finder` - used in method signature
- `BaseDistribution` from `pip._internal.metadata` - return type for metadata access

## Architectural Pattern
Follows the Template Method pattern where base class defines the interface but this concrete implementation provides minimal behavior for the "already installed" case. The class assumes `self.req.satisfied_by` is populated by the parent class infrastructure.

## Critical Invariants
- `self.req.satisfied_by` must not be `None` when `get_metadata_distribution()` is called
- No build tracking or metadata preparation needed since package is already installed
