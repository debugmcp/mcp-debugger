**Purpose**: Utility module for date comparison operations within pip's internal infrastructure.

**Core Functionality**:
- `today_is_later_than()` (L7-11): Compares current date against a specified date
  - Parameters: year, month, day integers
  - Returns: boolean indicating if today's date is after the given date
  - Uses `datetime.date.today()` for current date and `datetime.date()` constructor for comparison date
  - Performs simple greater-than comparison between date objects

**Dependencies**:
- `datetime` module for date operations

**Usage Context**: 
Designed for pip's internal date-based checks, likely for deprecation warnings, version expiration, or time-sensitive feature toggles. The function name suggests it's used to determine if certain time-based conditions have been met.

**Architecture Notes**:
- Simple utility function with no state or side effects
- Direct date comparison without timezone considerations (uses local system date)
- Minimal error handling - relies on datetime module's validation
