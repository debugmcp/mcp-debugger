## Purpose
Implements custom infinity types for Python packaging version comparison and ordering. Provides mathematical infinity semantics through singleton objects that behave consistently in comparison operations.

## Key Classes and Functions

### InfinityType (L6-30)
Implements positive infinity behavior:
- `__repr__()` (L7-8): Returns "Infinity" string representation
- `__hash__()` (L10-11): Hash based on string representation for dict/set usage
- `__lt__`, `__le__` (L13-17): Always False - nothing is greater than infinity
- `__eq__` (L19-20): True only for other InfinityType instances
- `__gt__`, `__ge__` (L22-26): Always True - infinity is greater than everything
- `__neg__` (L28-29): Returns NegativeInfinity singleton

### NegativeInfinityType (L35-59)
Implements negative infinity behavior with inverse comparison logic:
- `__repr__()` (L36-37): Returns "-Infinity" string representation  
- `__hash__()` (L39-40): Hash based on string representation
- `__lt__`, `__le__` (L42-46): Always True - negative infinity is less than everything
- `__eq__` (L48-49): True only for other NegativeInfinityType instances
- `__gt__`, `__ge__` (L51-55): Always False - nothing is less than negative infinity
- `__neg__` (L57-58): Returns Infinity singleton

## Singletons
- `Infinity` (L32): Global singleton instance of InfinityType
- `NegativeInfinity` (L61): Global singleton instance of NegativeInfinityType

## Architecture Pattern
Uses singleton pattern with comparison operator overloading to create mathematical infinity objects. Designed for version number comparison where infinity represents "latest" or unbounded versions.

## Key Relationships
- Mutual negation relationship between the two infinity types
- Part of pip's packaging utilities for version constraint handling
- Integrates with Python's comparison protocol for sorting and ordering operations
