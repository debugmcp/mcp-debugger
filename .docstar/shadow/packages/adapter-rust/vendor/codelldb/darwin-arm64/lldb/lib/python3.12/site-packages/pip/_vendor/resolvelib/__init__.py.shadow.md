## Purpose
Package initialization module for resolvelib - a generic dependency resolution library. Acts as the primary public API entry point, exposing core classes and exceptions for dependency resolution workflows.

## Public API Exports
- **Version**: `__version__ = "1.0.1"` (L14)
- **Core Classes**: AbstractProvider, AbstractResolver, BaseReporter, Resolver
- **Exception Hierarchy**: ResolutionError, ResolutionImpossible, ResolutionTooDeep, RequirementsConflicted, InconsistentCandidate

## Module Structure
**Imports from submodules:**
- `providers` module (L17): AbstractProvider, AbstractResolver - Define interfaces for dependency providers and resolvers
- `reporters` module (L18): BaseReporter - Base class for resolution progress reporting
- `resolvers` module (L19-26): Main Resolver implementation and all exception classes

## Key Dependencies
- **Internal modules**: `.providers`, `.reporters`, `.resolvers`
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with abstract interfaces in providers, reporting in reporters, and concrete implementation/exceptions in resolvers

## Usage Pattern
This is a typical Python package `__init__.py` that flattens the internal module structure for external consumers. Users import directly from `resolvelib` rather than navigating submodules (e.g., `from resolvelib import Resolver` instead of `from resolvelib.resolvers import Resolver`).

## API Contract
The `__all__` list (L1-12) explicitly controls public API surface, ensuring only intended classes/functions are exposed during `from resolvelib import *` operations.
