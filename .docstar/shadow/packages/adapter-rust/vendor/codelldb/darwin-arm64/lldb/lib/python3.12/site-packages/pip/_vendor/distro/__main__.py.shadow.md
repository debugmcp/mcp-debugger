**Purpose**: Entry point module for the `distro` package when executed as a script. Provides command-line interface functionality by delegating to the main function from the distro module.

**Key Components**:
- `main()` import (L1): Imports the main entry point function from the `.distro` module
- Script execution guard (L3-4): Standard Python idiom that calls `main()` when the module is executed directly rather than imported

**Dependencies**:
- `.distro` module: Contains the actual implementation of the main function

**Architectural Pattern**:
This follows the common Python pattern of separating the main implementation from the entry point, allowing the package to be executed with `python -m distro` while keeping the core logic in a separate module.

**Usage Context**:
Located within pip's vendored dependencies (`pip/_vendor/distro/`), this suggests it's part of pip's bundled copy of the distro library used for Linux distribution detection. The file enables command-line usage of the distro tool within pip's ecosystem.
