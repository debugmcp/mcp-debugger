## Purpose
Compatibility shim module for abstract base classes (ABC) imports across Python versions. Provides consistent access to `Mapping` and `Sequence` abstract base classes regardless of Python version.

## Key Functionality
- **Import Fallback Logic (L3-6)**: Implements try/except pattern to handle Python version differences
  - Primary: Import from `collections.abc` (Python 3.3+)
  - Fallback: Import from `collections` (older Python versions)
- **Public Interface (L1)**: Exports `Mapping` and `Sequence` classes via `__all__`

## Dependencies
- `collections.abc` (preferred, modern Python)
- `collections` (fallback for compatibility)

## Architectural Pattern
Classic compatibility shim using exception-based feature detection. This pattern ensures the module works across Python versions where abstract base classes were moved from `collections` to `collections.abc` in Python 3.3.

## Usage Context
Part of `resolvelib` dependency resolution library, specifically used by pip's vendored copy. Enables the library to work with different Python environments without version-specific code in consuming modules.
