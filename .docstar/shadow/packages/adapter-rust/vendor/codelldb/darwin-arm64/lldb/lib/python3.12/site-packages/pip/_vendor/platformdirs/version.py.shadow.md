## Primary Purpose
Auto-generated version metadata file for the platformdirs package, managed by setuptools_scm. Contains version information in both string and tuple formats for programmatic access.

## Key Components
- **Version Constants (L15-16)**: Core version definitions
  - `__version__` and `version`: String version "4.2.1"  
  - `__version_tuple__` and `version_tuple`: Tuple version (4, 2, 1)

- **Type Annotations (L3-13)**: Conditional type hints for VERSION_TUPLE
  - Uses TYPE_CHECKING guard to avoid runtime typing imports
  - Defines VERSION_TUPLE as Tuple[Union[int, str], ...] for type checkers
  - Falls back to object type at runtime

## Architecture Notes
- **Build Tool Integration**: Generated by setuptools_scm, not manually maintained
- **Dual Format Support**: Provides both string and tuple representations for different use cases
- **Type Safety**: Implements proper typing without runtime overhead using TYPE_CHECKING pattern

## Dependencies
- No runtime dependencies
- Optional typing imports only for static analysis

## Critical Constraints
- File should not be manually edited (L2 comment)
- Not tracked in version control (L2 comment)
- Regenerated automatically during build process
