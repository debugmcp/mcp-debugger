## Purpose
Environment detection module for Google App Engine applications within urllib3's contrib package. Provides utilities to identify different App Engine runtime contexts (local development, production, sandbox generations).

## Key Functions

### `is_appengine()` (L8-9)
Master detection function that returns True if running in any App Engine environment (local or production). Combines results from `is_local_appengine()` and `is_prod_appengine()`.

### `is_appengine_sandbox()` (L12-19)
Detects first-generation App Engine sandbox (Python 2.7 runtime). Returns True only when both in App Engine and `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` environment variable equals "python27". Second-generation runtimes have less restrictive sandboxes and typically don't require special handling.

### `is_local_appengine()` (L22-25)
Identifies local development environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` environment variable and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Development/".

### `is_prod_appengine()` (L28-31)
Identifies production App Engine environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` environment variable and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Google App Engine/".

### `is_prod_appengine_mvms()` (L34-36)
Deprecated function that always returns False. Legacy function likely related to Managed VMs (now called App Engine flexible environment).

## Dependencies
- `os` module for environment variable access

## Environment Variables Used
- `APPENGINE_RUNTIME`: Indicates App Engine runtime type
- `SERVER_SOFTWARE`: Contains server identification string

## Architecture Notes
Detection strategy relies on Google App Engine's consistent environment variable patterns. Functions use defensive programming with `os.environ.get()` to avoid KeyError exceptions when environment variables are missing.
