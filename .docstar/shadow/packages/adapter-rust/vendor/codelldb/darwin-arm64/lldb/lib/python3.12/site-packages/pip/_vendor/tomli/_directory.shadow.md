## Overall Purpose
The `tomli` directory is a complete TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) parser library implementation, providing functionality to parse TOML configuration files into Python data structures. It's a vendored dependency within the pip package ecosystem, specifically version 2.0.1.

## Architecture Overview
The module follows a clean separation of concerns with distinct layers:

**Public API Layer** (`__init__.py`): Exposes a minimal, clean interface
- `loads(s)`: Parse TOML from string
- `load(fp)`: Parse TOML from file-like object  
- `TOMLDecodeError`: Exception for parsing errors

**Core Parser Engine** (`_parser.py`): The main parsing implementation
- Character-level parser with comprehensive TOML specification support
- Handles all TOML constructs: tables, arrays of tables, inline tables, arrays, strings, numbers, dates
- Implements namespace conflict detection and immutability enforcement
- Provides detailed error reporting with position tracking

**Pattern Matching Layer** (`_re.py`): Regex-based parsing for complex types
- Number parsing (integers, floats, hex, binary, octal with underscores)
- DateTime parsing (dates, times, timezones)
- Cached timezone object creation for performance

**Type System** (`_types.py`): Core type definitions
- `ParseFloat`: Pluggable float parsing interface
- `Key`: Hierarchical key representation as tuple of strings
- `Pos`: Character position tracking for error reporting

## Data Flow
1. **Entry**: User calls `load()` or `loads()` from public API
2. **Parsing**: `_parser.py` processes TOML character-by-character using a state machine approach
3. **Type Resolution**: Complex values (numbers, dates) are parsed using regex patterns from `_re.py`
4. **Structure Building**: Nested dictionaries are constructed with namespace validation
5. **Error Handling**: Parse errors include precise position information for debugging

## Key Design Patterns
- **Single-pass parsing** with lookahead for syntax disambiguation
- **Immutable structures** for inline tables prevent post-creation modification
- **Namespace conflict detection** prevents TOML specification violations
- **Performance optimization** through ordered value type detection and LRU-cached timezone objects
- **Clean API facade** hiding internal implementation complexity

## Integration Context
This is a vendored copy within pip's dependency tree, providing TOML parsing capabilities for pip's configuration handling without external dependencies. The module is self-contained and follows Python packaging best practices with proper type annotations and comprehensive error handling.
