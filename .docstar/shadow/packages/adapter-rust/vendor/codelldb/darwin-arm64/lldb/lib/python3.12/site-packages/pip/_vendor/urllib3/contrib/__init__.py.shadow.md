## Purpose
Empty `__init__.py` file that designates the `contrib` directory as a Python package within the pip-vendored urllib3 library. This package likely contains optional or experimental extensions to the core urllib3 functionality.

## Structure
- No classes, functions, or imports defined
- Serves purely as a package marker
- Located within the vendored urllib3 dependency chain: `pip/_vendor/urllib3/contrib/`

## Context
Part of the LLDB Python environment's pip installation, specifically the urllib3 contribution modules. The `contrib` package typically houses additional features like:
- Alternative HTTP adapters
- Security extensions
- Platform-specific implementations
- Experimental features

The empty nature suggests contrib modules are imported individually rather than through this package's `__all__` mechanism.
