**Purpose**: Compatibility shim module that provides resource access functionality for the pyproject_hooks `_in_process` subpackage. Acts as an initialization point that maintains Python 3.8+ compatibility while keeping the namespace clean.

**Key Components**:
- `_in_proc_script_path()` (L13-14, L16-18): Context manager function that returns a path to the `_in_process.py` script file, with two implementations based on Python version capability
- Version detection mechanism (L9-11): Uses `try/except` to check for `resources.files` availability to determine Python version

**Dependencies**:
- `importlib.resources`: Core dependency for resource file access
- `__package__`: References current package for resource location

**Architectural Decisions**:
- **Compatibility Strategy**: Implements feature detection rather than version checking to support Python 3.8
- **Namespace Isolation**: Deliberately minimal implementation to avoid shadowing backend imports (as noted in docstring L1-5)
- **Resource Abstraction**: Provides unified interface regardless of underlying `importlib.resources` API version

**Critical Constraints**:
- Must remain minimal to prevent import conflicts with build backends
- The directory containing this file is added to `sys.path`, making namespace pollution a concern
- Both implementation paths must return compatible context manager objects for file access

**Usage Pattern**: This module enables the parent package to locate and execute the `_in_process.py` script across different Python versions while maintaining a clean import environment for build backends.
