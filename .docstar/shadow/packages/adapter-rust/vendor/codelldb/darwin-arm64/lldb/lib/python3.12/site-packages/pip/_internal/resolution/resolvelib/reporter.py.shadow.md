## Purpose and Responsibility
This module implements reporter classes for pip's dependency resolution process using ResolveLib. It provides user feedback during backtracking scenarios and debugging capabilities for the dependency resolver.

## Key Classes

### PipReporter (L12-55)
Main reporter class that provides user-facing feedback during dependency resolution:
- **Purpose**: Tracks package rejection counts and provides progressive user warnings during backtracking
- **Key attributes**:
  - `reject_count_by_package` (L14): Tracks rejection count per package name
  - `_messages_at_reject_count` (L16-33): Maps rejection counts to user messages at thresholds 1, 8, and 13
- **Key methods**:
  - `rejecting_candidate()` (L35-55): Increments rejection count, logs progressive warnings, and provides detailed conflict information

### PipDebuggingReporter (L58-80)  
Debug reporter that logs all resolver events:
- **Purpose**: Provides comprehensive logging for debugging dependency resolution issues
- **Methods**: Logs entry/exit for resolver phases (`starting`, `starting_round`, `ending_round`, `ending`, `adding_requirement`, `rejecting_candidate`, `pinning`)

## Dependencies and Relationships
- Extends `BaseReporter` from `pip._vendor.resolvelib.reporters` (L5)
- Uses local types `Candidate` and `Requirement` from `.base` (L7)
- Integrates with Python's logging system via module logger (L9)

## Key Patterns
- **Progressive feedback**: User warnings escalate at rejection count thresholds (1→8→13) to manage user expectations during long resolution times
- **Dual logging levels**: Uses INFO for user-facing messages and DEBUG for technical details
- **Template-based messaging**: Uses string formatting for consistent user messages with package names
- **Conflict reporting**: Provides detailed dependency chain information showing parent-child requirement relationships

## Critical Behavior
- Rejection count tracking is cumulative per package name across the entire resolution process
- Warning messages include guidance URL for backtracking issues at count 13
- Debug reporter logs all resolver lifecycle events for comprehensive troubleshooting
