## Overall Purpose
The `compat` directory provides a compatibility layer for the resolvelib dependency resolution library, ensuring cross-version Python compatibility. This module abstracts away Python version differences to provide a consistent interface for core abstract base classes used throughout the library.

## Key Components
- **`__init__.py`**: Empty package marker that establishes the `compat` directory as a Python package, enabling imports from the compatibility layer
- **`collections_abc.py`**: Compatibility shim that provides unified access to `Mapping` and `Sequence` abstract base classes across Python versions

## Public API Surface
The primary entry point is through `collections_abc` module which exports:
- `Mapping` - Abstract base class for mapping types
- `Sequence` - Abstract base class for sequence types

These are accessed consistently regardless of Python version (pre/post 3.3 when ABCs moved from `collections` to `collections.abc`).

## Internal Organization
The directory follows a common compatibility pattern:
1. Package initialization via empty `__init__.py`
2. Feature-specific compatibility modules that handle version differences
3. Exception-based feature detection to gracefully fall back between import locations

## Architectural Patterns
- **Compatibility Shim Pattern**: Uses try/except blocks to handle import location changes across Python versions
- **Transparent Interface**: Consuming code can import from this module without knowing about underlying version differences
- **Vendored Context**: As part of pip's vendored resolvelib copy, ensures pip's dependency resolution works across diverse Python environments

## Data Flow
The compatibility layer sits between resolvelib's core logic and Python's standard library, providing stable import paths that resolve to the appropriate underlying implementations based on the runtime Python version.
