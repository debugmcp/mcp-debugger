## Purpose
Abstract base classes defining the core interface contracts for dependency resolution in the resolvelib library. This file establishes the protocol between resolution algorithms and domain-specific dependency providers.

## Core Classes

### AbstractProvider (L1-110)
Abstract base class that defines the provider interface for dependency resolution. Implementers must provide domain-specific logic for:

**Key Methods:**
- `identify(requirement_or_candidate)` (L4-10): Returns unique identifier for requirements/candidates to enable merging and comparison
- `get_preference(identifier, resolutions, candidates, information, backtrack_causes)` (L12-61): Returns sort key for resolution priority - lower values = higher preference
- `find_matches(identifier, requirements, incompatibilities)` (L63-90): Finds all candidates satisfying constraints, returns ordered by preference  
- `is_satisfied_by(requirement, candidate)` (L92-101): Boolean check if candidate satisfies requirement
- `get_dependencies(candidate)` (L103-109): Returns collection of requirements that candidate depends on

### AbstractResolver (L112-133)
Abstract base class for resolution algorithms that coordinate the resolution process.

**Key Components:**
- `base_exception` (L115): Exception class hierarchy root
- Constructor takes `provider` and `reporter` (L117-119)
- `resolve(requirements, **kwargs)` (L121-133): Main resolution entry point, returns result with `mapping` attribute containing identifier→candidate mappings

## Architecture Pattern
Implements Strategy pattern - AbstractProvider encapsulates domain-specific resolution logic while AbstractResolver handles the generic resolution algorithm. The provider acts as a delegate for domain-specific operations.

## Key Contracts
- All methods raise `NotImplementedError` - pure abstract interface
- `get_preference` uses reverse=False sorting (lower values preferred)
- `find_matches` must exclude all incompatibilities from results
- Resolution result guarantees `mapping` attribute with final candidate assignments
