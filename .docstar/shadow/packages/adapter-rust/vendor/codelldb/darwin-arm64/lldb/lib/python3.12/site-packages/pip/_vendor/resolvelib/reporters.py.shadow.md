**Primary Purpose**
Defines the `BaseReporter` interface for providing progress reporting and debugging callbacks during dependency resolution in resolvelib. This is an abstract base class that allows external consumers to monitor the resolver's internal state transitions and decision-making process.

**Key Components**

- `BaseReporter` (L1-43): Abstract reporter interface with lifecycle and decision tracking methods
  - `starting()` (L4-5): Resolution initialization hook
  - `starting_round(index)` (L7-11): Per-round start callback with zero-based round index
  - `ending_round(index, state)` (L13-18): Per-round completion callback (excludes final round)
  - `ending(state)` (L20-21): Final resolution success callback
  - `adding_requirement(requirement, parent)` (L23-31): New requirement addition tracking
  - `resolving_conflicts(causes)` (L33-37): Conflict resolution attempt notification
  - `rejecting_candidate(criterion, candidate)` (L39-40): Backtracking rejection tracking
  - `pinning(candidate)` (L42-43): Candidate selection confirmation

**Key Patterns**
- Observer pattern implementation for resolver state monitoring
- All methods are no-op stubs, intended for subclass implementation
- State parameter provides resolver context at key transition points
- Parent-child relationship tracking for dependency hierarchies

**Dependencies**
- No external dependencies, pure Python base class

**Architectural Notes**
- Designed as delegate/observer for `Resolver` class integration
- Enables debugging, logging, and progress visualization without coupling to resolver core
- Round-based resolution model with explicit start/end boundaries
