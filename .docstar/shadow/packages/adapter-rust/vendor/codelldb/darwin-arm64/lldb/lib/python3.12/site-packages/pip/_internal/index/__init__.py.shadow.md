**Purpose**: Package index module initialization file for pip's internal index interaction functionality.

**Structure**: This is a minimal `__init__.py` file (L1-2) that serves as the entry point for pip's package index handling system. The module docstring indicates this package contains code for interacting with package indexes (likely PyPI and other package repositories).

**Key Components**: 
- Module-level docstring (L1-2) describes the package's purpose as "Index interaction code"
- No classes, functions, or imports defined in this file
- Serves as a namespace marker for the `pip._internal.index` package

**Dependencies**: None explicitly defined in this file.

**Architectural Notes**: This follows Python's standard package structure pattern where `__init__.py` files mark directories as packages. The actual index interaction functionality is likely implemented in sibling modules within the same package directory.

**Context**: Part of pip's internal API for handling package index operations, including package discovery, metadata retrieval, and download coordination from package repositories.
