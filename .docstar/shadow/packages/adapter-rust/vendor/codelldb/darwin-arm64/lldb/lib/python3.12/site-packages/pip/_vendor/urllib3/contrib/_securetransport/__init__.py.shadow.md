## Purpose
Empty initialization file for the `_securetransport` subpackage within pip's vendored urllib3 library. This module is part of the SecureTransport backend implementation for SSL/TLS connections on macOS/iOS platforms.

## Architecture
This `__init__.py` file serves as a package marker, making `_securetransport` importable as a Python package. The actual SecureTransport implementation would be contained in sibling modules within this directory.

## Context
Located within pip's vendored urllib3 at `packages/adapter-rust/vendor/codelldb/darwin-arm64/lldb/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_vendor/urllib3/contrib/_securetransport/`, indicating this is:
- Part of a Rust adapter package
- Bundled with CodeLLDB debugging tools
- Platform-specific for Darwin ARM64 architecture
- Integrated with LLDB's Python 3.12 environment

## Dependencies
None explicitly defined in this file.

## Key Components
No classes, functions, or variables defined - file is empty except for potential implicit package initialization behavior.

## Patterns
Standard Python package initialization pattern using empty `__init__.py` file.
