## Purpose
Defines a data structure representing a potential package installation candidate in pip's dependency resolution system. This is a core model for representing packages that could be selected for installation.

## Key Components

### InstallationCandidate class (L10-25)
Immutable dataclass representing a package candidate with:
- `name`: Package name as string
- `version`: Parsed Version object from packaging library
- `link`: Link object containing download/source information

**Constructor (L19-22)**: Takes string version parameter and parses it into Version object using `parse_version`. Uses `object.__setattr__` to bypass frozen dataclass immutability during initialization.

**String representation (L24-25)**: Provides human-readable format showing name, version, and link location.

## Dependencies
- `packaging.version.Version`: For version parsing and comparison
- `pip._internal.models.link.Link`: For package source/download location
- `dataclasses`: For structured data definition

## Design Patterns
- **Frozen dataclass**: Ensures immutability after creation, preventing accidental modification
- **Custom `__init__`**: Overrides dataclass auto-generation to parse version strings into Version objects
- **Explicit `__slots__`**: Memory optimization for frequently created objects

## Key Characteristics
- Immutable once created (frozen=True)
- Version strings automatically parsed into comparable Version objects
- Designed for use in collections and comparison operations during dependency resolution
- Represents the "what could be installed" concept in pip's architecture
