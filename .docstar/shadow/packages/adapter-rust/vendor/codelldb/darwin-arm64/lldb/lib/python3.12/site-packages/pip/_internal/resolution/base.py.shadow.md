## Primary Purpose
Base resolver interface for pip's dependency resolution system. Defines the contract that concrete resolvers must implement to handle package dependency resolution and installation ordering.

## Key Components

### Type Alias
- **InstallRequirementProvider** (L6-8): Callable type alias for functions that take a package name (str) and optional InstallRequirement, returning an InstallRequirement instance. Used for requirement provisioning.

### Base Class
- **BaseResolver** (L11-20): Abstract base class defining the resolver interface
  - `resolve()` (L12-15): Core resolution method that takes root requirements and wheel support flag, returns a RequirementSet. Pure virtual method requiring implementation.
  - `get_installation_order()` (L17-20): Determines installation sequence from a RequirementSet, returns ordered list of InstallRequirements. Pure virtual method requiring implementation.

## Dependencies
- `pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement`: Core requirement representation
- `pip._internal.req.req_set.RequirementSet`: Container for resolved requirements

## Architectural Pattern
Classic template method pattern - defines interface contract without implementation. Concrete resolvers (likely legacy and modern variants) inherit from this base to provide specific resolution algorithms while maintaining consistent API.

## Usage Context
Part of pip's internal resolution subsystem, likely instantiated by higher-level package management components that need to resolve dependency graphs and determine safe installation order.
