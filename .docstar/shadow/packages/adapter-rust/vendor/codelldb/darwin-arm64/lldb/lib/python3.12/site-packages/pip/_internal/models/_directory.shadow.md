## Purpose
Core data models for pip's internal architecture that represent various entities in the package management and installation pipeline. This module provides structured representations of packages, installation sources, format constraints, and compatibility specifications used throughout pip's dependency resolution and installation processes.

## Key Components

### Package Representation Models
- **`InstallationCandidate`** (`candidate.py`): Immutable representation of potential package installations with name, version, and download link
- **`Link`** (`link.py`): Comprehensive model for package distribution URLs with hash validation, metadata extraction, and equivalence checking
- **`Wheel`** (`wheel.py`): Parser and validator for wheel filenames with PEP 425/427 compatibility tag matching

### Installation Source Tracking  
- **`DirectUrl`** (`direct_url.py`): PEP 610 compliant metadata for tracking package installation sources (VCS, archives, local directories) with credential redaction
- **`InstallationReport`** (`installation_report.py`): Generates standardized JSON reports of package installations following PEP standards

### Configuration and Preferences
- **`FormatControl`** (`format_control.py`): Manages binary vs source package installation constraints with special token support (`:all:`, `:none:`)
- **`SelectionPreferences`** (`selection_prefs.py`): Configuration object for candidate selection behavior (prereleases, yanked packages, format preferences)
- **`TargetPython`** (`target_python.py`): Encapsulates target interpreter properties for compatibility checking with lazy-loaded PEP 425 tag computation

### Installation Infrastructure
- **`Scheme`** (`scheme.py`): Standard directory structure for package installation paths (platlib, purelib, headers, scripts, data)
- **`SearchScope`** (`search_scope.py`): Package search configuration including PyPI indexes and find-links with URL normalization
- **`PackageIndex`** (`index.py`): Models for PyPI endpoints with pre-configured instances for production and test environments

## Public API Surface
The module serves as a namespace container with no direct exports from `__init__.py`. Main entry points are the individual model classes:

- `InstallationCandidate` - for representing installation options
- `Link` - for URL parsing and validation (with factory methods `from_json()`, `from_element()`)
- `DirectUrl` - for installation source tracking (with `from_json()`/`to_json()`)
- `Wheel` - for wheel compatibility checking
- `FormatControl` - for format constraint management
- `TargetPython` - for compatibility tag generation

## Internal Organization and Data Flow
Models follow several key patterns:
1. **Immutable data structures**: Most classes use frozen dataclasses or `__slots__` for memory efficiency
2. **Factory methods**: Complex parsing logic encapsulated in `from_*()` class methods
3. **Lazy computation**: Expensive operations (tag generation, URL parsing) are cached using `@lru_cache`
4. **Validation**: Input validation and normalization at construction time
5. **Serialization**: JSON round-trip support for metadata persistence

## Important Patterns and Conventions
- **PEP compliance**: Models implement various Python packaging PEPs (425, 427, 566, 592, 610, 714)
- **Security-conscious**: Credential redaction in URLs and hash validation throughout
- **Performance optimized**: Caching, slots, and efficient data structures for frequently created objects
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive type hints and runtime validation
- **Cross-platform**: Handles Windows UNC paths, URL encoding, and platform-specific file paths

The models work together to provide a complete representation of pip's package management domain, from initial discovery through final installation tracking.
