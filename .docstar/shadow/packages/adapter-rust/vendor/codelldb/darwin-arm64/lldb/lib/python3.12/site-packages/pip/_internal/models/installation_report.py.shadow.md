## InstallationReport

Data model for generating standardized installation reports in pip. Creates structured JSON reports of package installations following PEP standards.

### Primary Purpose
- Generates installation reports containing metadata about installed packages
- Formats data according to PEP 610 (direct URL references) and PEP 566 (metadata encoding)
- Tracks installation context including user-requested vs dependency packages

### Key Components

**InstallationReport class (L9-56)**
- Constructor takes sequence of InstallRequirement objects (L10-11)
- Converts installation data to structured dictionary format

**_install_req_to_dict() method (L14-40)**
- Static method converting InstallRequirement to dictionary representation
- Extracts download_info (PEP 610 JSON format) for package source tracking (L21)
- Records installation flags:
  - `is_direct`: Direct URL reference vs index download (L25)  
  - `is_yanked`: Package yanked status per PEP 592 (L28)
  - `requested`: User-supplied vs dependency (L32)
- Includes package metadata dict per PEP 566 (L35)
- Conditionally adds requested_extras for user-supplied packages (L37-39)

**to_dict() method (L42-56)**
- Generates complete report structure with version "1" format
- Includes pip version and environment markers (PEP 508)
- Transforms all install requirements using _install_req_to_dict()

### Dependencies
- InstallRequirement from pip._internal.req.req_install (L6)
- packaging.markers for environment detection (L3)
- pip.__version__ for version reporting (L5)

### Architecture Notes
- Immutable data transformation pattern - no state modification after construction
- Follows PEP standards for metadata serialization
- Environment reporting uses default environment (see TODO L50-54 for future enhancements)

### Critical Constraints
- Requires InstallRequirement.download_info to be present (assertion L15)
- Only adds requested_extras for user-supplied packages with extras
