## Purpose and Responsibility
This is an empty `__init__.py` file that serves as a Python package marker for `pip._internal.resolution.resolvelib`. It makes the directory a Python package, allowing imports from the resolvelib resolution module within pip's internal architecture.

## Key Components
- **File Structure**: Empty package initializer
- **Location**: Part of pip's internal resolution system, specifically the resolvelib adapter layer
- **Function**: Enables Python to treat the directory as an importable package

## Dependencies and Relationships
- **Parent Package**: `pip._internal.resolution` - pip's dependency resolution subsystem
- **Package Role**: Likely contains resolvelib-specific resolution logic and adapters
- **Import Path**: `pip._internal.resolution.resolvelib`

## Architectural Context
- Located within pip's vendored codelldb distribution for Darwin ARM64
- Part of pip's internal resolution infrastructure that handles dependency solving
- The resolvelib package likely contains concrete implementations of resolution algorithms

## Notable Patterns
- Standard Python package structure using empty `__init__.py`
- Follows pip's internal module organization conventions
- Part of a vendored distribution suggesting this is a specific version bundled with the adapter
