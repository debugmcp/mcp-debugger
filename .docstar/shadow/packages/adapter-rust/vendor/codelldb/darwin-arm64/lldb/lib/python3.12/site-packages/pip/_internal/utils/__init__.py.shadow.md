## Purpose and Responsibility
This is an empty `__init__.py` file that serves as a Python package marker for the `pip._internal.utils` module. It makes the `utils` directory recognizable as a Python package, allowing other modules to import utilities from this package.

## Key Components
- No classes, functions, or variables defined
- Empty file structure typical of package initialization modules

## Dependencies and Relationships
- Part of the pip internal utilities package hierarchy
- Enables imports like `from pip._internal.utils import <module>`
- Located within the pip installation bundled with a Rust adapter's LLDB Python environment

## Architectural Context
- Standard Python package pattern - the presence of this file allows the `utils` directory to be treated as a package
- Part of pip's internal API structure, suggesting this directory contains utility modules used internally by pip
- Located in a vendored LLDB environment, indicating this pip installation is embedded within development tooling

## Notable Patterns
- Follows Python's implicit package initialization pattern (empty `__init__.py`)
- No explicit exports or initialization code, relying on Python's default package behavior
