## Purpose
Package initialization file for pip's internal models module. Serves as the entry point for accessing entity representation classes used throughout pip's internal architecture.

## Structure
- **Package marker**: Simple `__init__.py` file with docstring only (L1-2)
- **No exports**: Empty module that relies on submodule imports for functionality

## Dependencies
None directly imported in this file.

## Architectural Role
Acts as a namespace container for pip's internal model classes that represent various entities (packages, requirements, dependencies, etc.). The actual model implementations are expected to be in submodules within this package.

## Usage Pattern
This follows Python's standard package organization where `__init__.py` serves as a marker and documentation point, with actual functionality distributed across submodules.
