**Purpose**: Empty Python package initialization file for pip's vendored urllib3.packages module.

**Structure**: This is a completely empty `__init__.py` file that serves solely to mark the `packages` directory as a Python package within pip's vendored urllib3 distribution.

**Functionality**: 
- No classes, functions, or variables defined
- No imports or exports
- Enables Python to treat the `packages` directory as an importable module
- Part of pip's vendoring strategy to bundle third-party dependencies

**Context**: Located within the LLDB Python environment for the CodeLLDB Rust adapter, indicating this is part of a debugging toolchain that includes a complete pip installation with vendored dependencies.

**Dependencies**: None - this file has no code content.

**Architectural Role**: Minimal package marker in pip's vendored urllib3 hierarchy, likely containing sub-packages or modules that handle urllib3's package management or compatibility layers.
