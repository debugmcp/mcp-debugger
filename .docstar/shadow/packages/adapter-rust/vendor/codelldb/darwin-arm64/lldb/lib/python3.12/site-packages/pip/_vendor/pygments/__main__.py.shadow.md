**Primary Purpose**: Entry point module for running Pygments as a command-line application via `python -m pygments`.

**Core Functionality**:
- **main() execution (L15)**: Delegates to `pip._vendor.pygments.cmdline.main()` with command-line arguments
- **KeyboardInterrupt handling (L16-17)**: Gracefully exits with status code 1 on Ctrl+C interruption

**Dependencies**:
- `sys` module for command-line arguments and exit control
- `pip._vendor.pygments.cmdline.main` - the actual command-line interface implementation

**Architecture**:
- Simple proxy pattern - this module serves as a thin wrapper around the real CLI implementation
- Standard Python module execution pattern for `-m` flag support
- Clean error handling for user interruption

**Key Characteristics**:
- Minimal 7-line implementation focused solely on bootstrapping
- Part of pip's vendored Pygments package (syntax highlighting library)
- Located in LLDB's Python environment, suggesting use in debugging/development tools
