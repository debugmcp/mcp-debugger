**Primary Purpose:** Defines the abstract base class protocol for Rich renderable objects using Python's ABC framework and duck typing.

**Core Components:**

- **RichRenderable (L4-18)**: Abstract base class that establishes the Rich renderable protocol
  - Uses `__subclasshook__` (L15-18) to implement structural subtyping via duck typing
  - Objects qualify as RichRenderable if they have `__rich_console__` OR `__rich__` methods
  - No need for explicit inheritance - works through protocol checking

**Protocol Detection Logic:**
The `__subclasshook__` method enables `isinstance()` checks without requiring inheritance. Objects are considered RichRenderable if they implement either rendering method:
- `__rich_console__`: Primary Rich rendering protocol method
- `__rich__`: Alternative Rich rendering method

**Dependencies:**
- `abc.ABC` for abstract base class functionality
- `pip._vendor.rich.text.Text` (test-only import)

**Usage Pattern:**
Designed for protocol checking rather than inheritance:
```python
if isinstance(my_object, RichRenderable):
    console.print(my_object)
```

**Architectural Decision:** Uses structural typing over nominal typing, allowing any object with the appropriate methods to be treated as a Rich renderable without explicit class inheritance.

**Test Code (L21-33):** Demonstrates protocol detection with Text objects, plain classes, and built-in types.
