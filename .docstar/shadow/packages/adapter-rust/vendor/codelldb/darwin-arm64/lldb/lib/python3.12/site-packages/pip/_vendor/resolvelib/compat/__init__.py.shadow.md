## Primary Purpose
Empty compatibility module for resolvelib package. This `__init__.py` file serves as a package marker to make the `compat` directory a Python package, allowing imports from the compatibility layer.

## Key Components
- No classes, functions, or variables defined
- Empty module with no implementation

## Dependencies
- No explicit imports or dependencies

## Architecture
This appears to be part of a compatibility layer structure within the resolvelib dependency resolution library. The empty nature suggests either:
- Placeholder for future compatibility utilities
- Package initialization that relies on submodules
- Minimalist approach where compatibility logic is handled in submodules

## Usage Context
Located within pip's vendored copy of resolvelib, indicating this is part of pip's dependency resolution system. The `compat` package likely contains version-specific or platform-specific compatibility code in other modules.
