**Primary Purpose**: Empty Python package initializer for pip's legacy dependency resolution module.

**File Structure**: This is an `__init__.py` file that serves as a package marker for the `pip._internal.resolution.legacy` module, which contains pip's legacy dependency resolution implementation.

**Functionality**: 
- Makes the `legacy` directory a proper Python package
- Provides no explicit exports or initialization code
- Part of pip's internal resolution system hierarchy under `pip._internal.resolution`

**Dependencies**: None explicitly imported or defined

**Architectural Context**: 
- Located within pip's internal resolution subsystem
- Represents the legacy resolution strategy (as opposed to newer resolvers)
- Part of the broader pip package management infrastructure
- Follows Python package structure conventions

**Usage Pattern**: This file enables imports like `from pip._internal.resolution.legacy import <module>` for other components in the legacy resolution system.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Empty file with no executable code
- Standard Python package initialization pattern
- Part of pip's modular resolution architecture
