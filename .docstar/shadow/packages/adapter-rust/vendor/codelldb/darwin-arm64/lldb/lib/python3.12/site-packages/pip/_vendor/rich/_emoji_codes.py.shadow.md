## Primary Purpose
Static emoji lookup dictionary for the Rich library, providing mapping from emoji names to Unicode emoji characters.

## Core Data Structure
**EMOJI Dictionary (L1-3610)**: Massive dictionary containing 3,609 emoji mappings from descriptive string names to their corresponding Unicode emoji characters. The structure follows the pattern:
```
"emoji_name": "🔥"
```

## Key Categories and Organization
The dictionary is organized into several major categories:

**Flags and Countries (L8-341)**: Country flags, territories, and regional indicators
- Examples: "afghanistan": "🇦🇫", "united_states": "🇺🇸"

**People and Body Parts (L345-2736)**: Human figures, faces, gestures, and anatomical elements
- Includes skin tone variants (e.g., "_dark_skin_tone", "_light_skin_tone")
- Professional roles, family structures, activities

**Objects and Symbols (L342-2767)**: Physical items, tools, symbols, and miscellaneous objects
- Buildings, vehicles, food items, nature elements

**Aliases and Legacy Names (L2812-3610)**: Alternative names for the same emoji characters
- Example: "car": "🚗", "red_car": "🚗"

## Unicode Handling
- Uses proper Unicode escape sequences for complex emojis
- Handles multi-codepoint emojis (e.g., flags using regional indicators)
- Includes zero-width joiner sequences for composite emojis

## Usage Pattern
This dictionary serves as a static lookup table for emoji rendering in Rich's text formatting system, allowing users to reference emojis by human-readable names rather than Unicode codepoints.

## Notable Features
- Comprehensive coverage of Unicode emoji set
- Descriptive naming convention with underscores
- Skin tone modifier support
- Professional and activity variants
- Cross-platform emoji compatibility focus
