**Purpose**: Empty Python package initialization file for pip's internal resolution module.

**Module Structure**:
- File is completely empty (0 lines of functional code)
- Serves as a package marker to make the `resolution` directory a valid Python package
- Part of pip's internal dependency resolution system architecture

**Functional Role**:
- Enables importing from `pip._internal.resolution` namespace
- Likely contains submodules for dependency resolution algorithms (resolvelib, legacy resolver)
- No classes, functions, or variables defined in this file

**Dependencies**: None (empty file)

**Architectural Context**:
- Located within pip's internal API structure (`pip._internal`)
- Part of the resolution subsystem that handles package dependency solving
- Follows standard Python package organization patterns
