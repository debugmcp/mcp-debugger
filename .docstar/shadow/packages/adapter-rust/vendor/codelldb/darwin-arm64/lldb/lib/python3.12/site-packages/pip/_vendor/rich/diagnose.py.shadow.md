**Primary Purpose**: Diagnostic utility module for the Rich terminal library that generates debugging reports about the console environment and capabilities.

**Core Components**:

- `report()` function (L10-34): Main diagnostic function that prints comprehensive debugging information including:
  - Console object inspection using Rich's inspect utility
  - Windows console feature detection and analysis
  - Environment variable collection for terminal-related settings
  - Platform system identification

**Key Dependencies**:
- `pip._vendor.rich.console`: Console class and Windows console feature detection
- `pip._vendor.rich.inspect`: Object introspection utilities
- `pip._vendor.rich.panel`: UI panel formatting for structured output
- `pip._vendor.rich.pretty`: Pretty-printing for complex data structures

**Environment Variables Monitored** (L17-29):
- Terminal identification: `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM`
- Color control: `CLICOLOR`, `NO_COLOR`
- Dimension settings: `COLUMNS`, `LINES`, `JUPYTER_COLUMNS`, `JUPYTER_LINES`
- Context detection: `JPY_PARENT_PID`, `VSCODE_VERBOSE_LOGGING`

**Architectural Patterns**:
- Simple diagnostic utility with single responsibility
- Uses Rich's own components for self-inspection and reporting
- Designed for interactive debugging and troubleshooting terminal issues
- Entry point available via direct execution (L36-37)

**Usage Context**: Typically invoked when diagnosing Rich rendering issues, terminal compatibility problems, or environment configuration conflicts. Part of pip's vendored Rich library for package management debugging.
