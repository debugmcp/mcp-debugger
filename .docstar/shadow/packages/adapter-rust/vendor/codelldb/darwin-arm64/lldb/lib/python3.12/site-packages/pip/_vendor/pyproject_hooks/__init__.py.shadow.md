**Primary Purpose:** Package initialization module for pyproject_hooks, a library that provides wrappers to call pyproject.toml-based build backend hooks. This module serves as the main public API entry point.

**Key Components:**
- **Imports (L4-12):** Re-exports all public components from the `_impl` module, including exception classes, the main hook caller class, and subprocess runner utilities
- **Version Declaration (L14):** Sets package version to '1.0.0'
- **Public API Definition (L15-23):** Explicitly defines the public interface via `__all__` list

**Exported Classes and Functions:**
- **Exception Classes:** `BackendUnavailable`, `BackendInvalid`, `HookMissing`, `UnsupportedOperation` - handle various build backend error conditions
- **Core Functionality:** `BuildBackendHookCaller` - main class for invoking build backend hooks
- **Utility Functions:** `default_subprocess_runner`, `quiet_subprocess_runner` - subprocess execution helpers with different verbosity levels

**Architecture:** Classic Python package structure using `__init__.py` as a facade that re-exports implementation details from private modules (`_impl`). This pattern provides a stable public API while allowing internal reorganization.

**Dependencies:** Internal dependency on `._impl` module which contains the actual implementation.

**Usage Pattern:** This module follows PEP 517/518 standards for Python build systems, providing a standardized interface for build backends to implement wheel building, metadata extraction, and other build operations.
