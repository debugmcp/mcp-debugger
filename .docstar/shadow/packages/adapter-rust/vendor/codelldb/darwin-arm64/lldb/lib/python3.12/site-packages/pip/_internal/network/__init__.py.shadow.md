## Primary Purpose
This file serves as the package initializer for pip's internal network utilities module. It establishes the namespace for network-related functionality within pip's internal architecture.

## Structure and Content
- **Module docstring (L1-2)**: Declares the module's purpose as containing "purely network-related utilities"
- **Empty implementation**: No classes, functions, or imports are defined in this file

## Architectural Role
Acts as a namespace declaration for pip's network subsystem, allowing other modules to import network utilities via `pip._internal.network`. The actual network functionality is likely implemented in submodules within this package directory.

## Dependencies
None explicitly defined in this file.

## Notable Patterns
Follows Python's standard package initialization pattern with a minimal `__init__.py` file that serves primarily as a namespace marker.
