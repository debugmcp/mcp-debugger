## Primary Purpose
Version definition file for urllib3 package, providing a single source of truth for version information across the codebase.

## Key Elements
- `__version__` (L2): String constant defining the current urllib3 version as "1.26.18"

## Dependencies
None - this is a standalone version definition file with no imports or external dependencies.

## Architectural Notes
- Protected by CODEOWNERS mechanism (L1) to control version changes
- Follows standard Python packaging convention of defining `__version__` in a dedicated module
- Version follows semantic versioning format (major.minor.patch)
- Can be imported by setup.py, __init__.py, or other modules needing version information

## Usage Pattern
Typically imported as `from urllib3._version import __version__` to access version string programmatically for package metadata, user agent strings, or compatibility checks.
