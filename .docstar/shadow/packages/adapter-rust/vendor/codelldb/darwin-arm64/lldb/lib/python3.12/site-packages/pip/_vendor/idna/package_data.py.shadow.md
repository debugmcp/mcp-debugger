## Purpose
Version metadata file for the IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) package. Contains only the package version string for identification and compatibility checking.

## Key Elements
- `__version__` (L1): String literal '3.7' defining the IDNA package version

## Dependencies
None - standalone metadata file

## Architectural Role
Standard Python package metadata pattern. This file is typically imported by the main package `__init__.py` to expose version information to users and dependency management tools.

## Context
Part of the pip-vendored IDNA library within the LLDB Python environment for CodeLLDB (Rust debugging adapter). The vendoring isolates this dependency from system Python packages.
