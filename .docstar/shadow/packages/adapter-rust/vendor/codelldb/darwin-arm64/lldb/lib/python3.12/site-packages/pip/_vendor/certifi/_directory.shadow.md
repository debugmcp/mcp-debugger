## Directory Overview

This directory contains the `certifi` package, a critical SSL/TLS infrastructure component that provides Mozilla's trusted CA certificate bundle for Python applications. As a vendored dependency within pip, it ensures reliable SSL certificate verification across different environments and Python versions.

## Architecture & Component Organization

The module follows a clean layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **`__init__.py`**: Public API facade that exposes only essential functions (`contents`, `where`) while hiding internal implementation details
- **`core.py`**: Core implementation engine with sophisticated cross-version compatibility handling for Python 3.7+ through modern versions
- **`__main__.py`**: Command-line interface providing diagnostic access to certificate bundle information

## Public API Surface

**Primary Entry Points:**
- `certifi.where() -> str`: Returns filesystem path to the CA certificate bundle (cacert.pem)
- `certifi.contents() -> str`: Returns the raw certificate bundle contents as ASCII text
- **CLI Access**: `python -m certifi` for path output, `python -m certifi -c` for contents

## Key Technical Features

**Cross-Version Compatibility**: Core module implements version-specific branches:
- Python 3.11+: Modern `importlib.resources.files()` API
- Python 3.7-3.10: Transitional `importlib.resources.path()` API  
- Legacy fallback: Direct filesystem access for older versions

**Resource Management**: Sophisticated handling of packaged resources (zip files, wheels) with:
- Lazy loading and global caching for performance (`_CACERT_PATH`, _`CACERT_CTX`)
- Proper context manager lifecycle with `atexit` cleanup registration
- Temporary file extraction when certificates are embedded in packages

**Version Tracking**: Date-based versioning (e.g., "2024.02.02") reflects the snapshot date of Mozilla's certificate bundle, ensuring users can track certificate freshness.

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: `__init__.py` imports and re-exports core functions
2. **Path Resolution**: `where()` uses Python version-appropriate importlib.resources APIs to locate cacert.pem
3. **Caching Layer**: Global state management prevents repeated resource extraction
4. **Content Access**: `contents()` provides direct access to certificate data
5. **Cleanup**: Automatic resource cleanup via atexit handlers

## Integration Context

As a vendored component within pip's dependency tree (`pip._vendor.certifi`), this package provides the foundation for all SSL/TLS certificate verification in pip operations, ensuring secure package downloads and API communications regardless of system certificate store variations.
