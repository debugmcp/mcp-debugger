## Primary Purpose
Implements legacy editable package installation using `setup.py develop` command for pip's internal operations.

## Key Function
**`install_editable` (L15-47)**: Core function that performs editable installation by executing `setup.py develop` in a controlled environment. Takes comprehensive installation parameters including global options, path configurations, isolation settings, and build environment.

## Key Dependencies
- `BuildEnvironment` (L7): Manages isolated build context
- `make_setuptools_develop_args` (L9): Constructs setuptools command arguments
- `call_subprocess` (L10): Executes the setup.py process
- `indent_log` (L8): Provides log indentation for nested operations

## Implementation Pattern
Follows a wrapper pattern that:
1. Constructs setuptools develop arguments using helper function (L32-39)
2. Executes setup.py develop within nested contexts:
   - Indented logging context for visual hierarchy (L41)
   - Build environment context for isolation (L42)
   - Subprocess execution with proper error handling (L43-47)

## Critical Parameters
- `setup_py_path`: Path to setup.py file being executed
- `unpacked_source_directory`: Working directory for subprocess execution
- `build_env`: Isolated environment preventing system contamination
- `isolated`: Controls whether user configuration is respected

## Architectural Role
Part of pip's installation operation pipeline, specifically handling the legacy setuptools-based editable installation path before modern PEP 660 standards.
