## Purpose
Package initialization file for pip's command line interface module. Serves as an entry point to the CLI-related functionality without performing any imports.

## Structure
- **Module docstring (L1-2)**: Documents the subpackage's purpose as containing all CLI-related code
- **Import strategy (L4)**: Explicitly avoids importing submodules, likely for performance reasons or to prevent circular dependencies

## Key Characteristics
- Minimal initialization approach - defers module loading until explicitly requested
- Part of pip's internal CLI architecture located in `pip/_internal/cli/`
- Uses lazy loading pattern by intentionally avoiding submodule imports

## Dependencies
- None (intentionally minimal)

## Architectural Notes
- Follows Python package convention with `__init__.py` 
- The explicit comment about not importing submodules suggests this is a deliberate design decision, possibly to:
  - Improve startup time
  - Avoid circular import issues
  - Allow for selective loading of CLI components
