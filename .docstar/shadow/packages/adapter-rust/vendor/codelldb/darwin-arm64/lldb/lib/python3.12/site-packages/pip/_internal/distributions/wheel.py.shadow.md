## Purpose
Implements wheel distribution handling within pip's distribution abstraction system. Provides a concrete implementation for wheel packages that require no build preparation since wheels are pre-built artifacts.

## Key Components

### WheelDistribution Class (L16-42)
Concrete implementation of `AbstractDistribution` for wheel (.whl) files. Key characteristics:
- Inherits from `AbstractDistribution` (L5)
- No build preparation required as wheels are pre-built
- Direct metadata access from wheel files

### Properties and Methods

#### build_tracker_id (L22-24)
Returns `None` since wheels don't require build tracking (no compilation/build steps needed).

#### get_metadata_distribution (L26-34)
Core metadata loading method:
- Extracts metadata from wheel file into memory
- Creates `FilesystemWheel` wrapper (L33)
- Returns `BaseDistribution` via `get_wheel_distribution()` (L34)
- Requires `req.local_file_path` and `req.name` to be set (assertions L31-32)
- Uses canonicalized package names for consistency

#### prepare_distribution_metadata (L36-42)
No-op implementation - wheels require no metadata preparation since they're pre-built with embedded metadata.

## Dependencies
- `pip._vendor.packaging.utils.canonicalize_name`: Package name normalization
- `pip._internal.distributions.base.AbstractDistribution`: Base class
- `pip._internal.metadata`: Wheel metadata handling (`BaseDistribution`, `FilesystemWheel`, `get_wheel_distribution`)

## Architecture Notes
- Part of pip's distribution strategy pattern
- Optimized for wheels (no build phase needed)
- Relies on wheel files having complete, embedded metadata
- Assumes wheel files are already downloaded locally when metadata is accessed
