## Purpose
Implements the InstalledDistribution class for representing already-installed Python packages in pip's distribution system. This is part of pip's internal architecture for handling different types of package distributions (installed vs. to-be-installed).

## Key Components

**InstalledDistribution Class (L8-29)**
- Inherits from `AbstractDistribution` to provide concrete implementation for installed packages
- Represents packages that are already present on the system and require no preparation
- Core responsibility: provide metadata access for installed packages without build/installation overhead

**Key Methods:**
- `build_tracker_id` property (L16-17): Always returns None since installed packages don't need build tracking
- `get_metadata_distribution()` (L19-21): Returns the BaseDistribution from `self.req.satisfied_by` with assertion check
- `prepare_distribution_metadata()` (L23-29): No-op implementation since installed packages need no preparation

## Dependencies
- `AbstractDistribution`: Base class providing the distribution interface contract
- `PackageFinder`: Used in method signature but not actually utilized in this implementation  
- `BaseDistribution`: Metadata container type returned by `get_metadata_distribution()`

## Architectural Notes
- Follows the template method pattern where `AbstractDistribution` defines interface and this class provides installed-specific behavior
- The empty `prepare_distribution_metadata()` method reflects that installed packages bypass the preparation pipeline
- Critical invariant: `self.req.satisfied_by` must be non-None for installed distributions (enforced by assertion on L20)
