**Purpose**: Defines exit status codes for pip CLI operations, providing standardized return values for different command outcomes.

**Constants**:
- `SUCCESS` (L1): Standard success exit code (0)
- `ERROR` (L2): General error exit code (1) 
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` (L3): Unexpected/unhandled error (2)
- `VIRTUALENV_NOT_FOUND` (L4): Virtual environment lookup failure (3)
- `PREVIOUS_BUILD_DIR_ERROR` (L5): Build directory conflict/cleanup issue (4)
- `NO_MATCHES_FOUND` (L6): No packages found matching criteria (23)

**Architecture**: Simple constants module following Unix exit code conventions where 0 indicates success and non-zero values indicate specific failure modes. The gap between codes 4 and 23 suggests additional status codes may exist in other parts of the codebase or were removed.

**Usage Pattern**: These constants are imported by pip's CLI modules to provide consistent exit codes across different pip commands, enabling shell scripts and automation tools to programmatically handle pip operation results.
