**Purpose**: Unicode character terminal width lookup table for text rendering and terminal display calculations. Auto-generated data structure used by the Rich Python library to determine how many terminal columns a Unicode character occupies.

**Core Data Structure**:
- `CELL_WIDTHS` (L3-454): List of tuples defining Unicode character width mappings
  - Format: `(start_codepoint, end_codepoint, width)`
  - Width values: -1 (control/non-printable), 0 (zero-width/combining), 2 (wide/double-width)
  - Covers Unicode ranges from 0 to 917999

**Key Unicode Range Categories**:
- **Control Characters** (L4-6): Null chars (0-0), control chars (1-31, 127-159) marked as -1 width
- **Combining/Zero-width** (L7-400): Diacritical marks, formatters, and modifiers marked as 0 width
  - Arabic diacritics (768-879), Hebrew points (1425-1631), various script modifiers
- **Wide Characters** (L130-450): CJK ideographs and emoji marked as 2-width
  - Hangul (4352-4447), CJK Unified Ideographs (19968-42124), Emoji blocks (127744+)
- **Private Use Areas** (L451-453): Custom character ranges (917505-917999) marked as 0 width

**Dependencies**: 
- Generated by `make_terminal_widths.py` script (referenced in L1 comment)
- Part of Rich library's text measurement system for accurate terminal rendering
- Based on Unicode East Asian Width property and terminal display standards

**Usage Pattern**: Binary search or direct lookup for character width determination during text layout calculations. Essential for proper text alignment, wrapping, and cursor positioning in terminal applications.

**Critical Invariants**:
- Tuples ordered by ascending start codepoint for efficient searching
- Non-overlapping ranges ensure deterministic width lookup
- Covers all printable Unicode ranges requiring special width handling
