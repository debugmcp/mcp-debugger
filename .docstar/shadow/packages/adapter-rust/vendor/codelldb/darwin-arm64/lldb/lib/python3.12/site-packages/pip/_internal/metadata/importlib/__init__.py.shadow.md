## Primary Purpose
This file serves as the public interface for pip's importlib-based metadata backend, providing a standardized API for package metadata operations using Python's importlib.metadata system.

## Key Components
- **NAME constant (L6)**: Identifies this metadata backend as "importlib"
- **Distribution class import (L1)**: Core class for representing installed package distributions
- **Environment class import (L2)**: Manages collections of distributions in specific environments
- **__all__ export list (L4)**: Explicitly defines the public API surface

## Dependencies
- `._dists`: Internal module containing Distribution implementation
- `._envs`: Internal module containing Environment implementation

## Architectural Pattern
Follows pip's metadata backend plugin architecture where different backends (importlib, pkg_resources) provide consistent interfaces. This module acts as a facade, exposing only the essential classes through a controlled public API.

## Usage Context
Part of pip's internal metadata system used for package discovery, version resolution, and dependency management. The importlib backend is the modern replacement for pkg_resources-based metadata handling.
