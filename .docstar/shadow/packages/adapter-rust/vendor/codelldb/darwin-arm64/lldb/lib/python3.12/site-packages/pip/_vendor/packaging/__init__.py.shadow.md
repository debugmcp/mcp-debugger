**Primary Purpose**: Package metadata initialization file for the `packaging` library, defining version and author information accessible to Python's introspection mechanisms.

**Key Elements**:
- Package metadata constants (L5-15): Standard `__dunder__` attributes that provide library identification and licensing information
- Version declaration (L9): `__version__ = "24.1"` - critical for dependency resolution and compatibility checks
- Licensing information (L14): Dual-licensed under BSD-2-Clause or Apache-2.0

**Dependencies**: None - this is a pure metadata file with no imports or external dependencies.

**Architectural Notes**:
- Follows Python packaging conventions for `__init__.py` metadata exposure
- Uses string interpolation for copyright notice (L15) to maintain consistency with author field
- Serves as the canonical source for package version used by setuptools/pip

**Usage Context**: This file is part of pip's vendored packaging library, located in the LLDB Python environment for the Rust adapter. The metadata defined here is accessible via `packaging.__version__`, `packaging.__author__`, etc. for runtime introspection.
