## Purpose
Package initialization module for pip's requirement handling subsystem. Exposes core requirement processing functionality and provides the main installation orchestration function.

## Key Components

**InstallationResult (L22-25)**: Frozen dataclass representing the result of a successful package installation, containing only the package name.

**_validate_requirements (L27-32)**: Generator function that validates InstallRequirement objects, asserting each has a valid name and yielding (name, requirement) tuples for processing.

**install_given_reqs (L35-90)**: Main installation orchestration function that processes a list of InstallRequirement objects. Handles:
- Requirement validation and deduplication using OrderedDict
- Conditional uninstallation for reinstall scenarios (L62-67)
- Package installation with comprehensive error handling and rollback (L69-87)
- Returns list of InstallationResult objects

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: req_file.parse_requirements, req_install.InstallRequirement, req_set.RequirementSet
- **External**: collections.OrderedDict for maintaining installation order, logging for progress tracking
- **Utils**: pip._internal.utils.logging.indent_log for hierarchical log formatting

## Architecture Patterns
- **Transaction Safety**: Implements rollback mechanism for failed installations (L81-82, L85-86)
- **Logging Hierarchy**: Uses indent_log context manager for structured installation progress reporting
- **Generator-based Validation**: Lazy evaluation of requirements through generator pattern

## Critical Invariants
- All requirements must have valid names before installation
- Installation order is preserved through OrderedDict
- Uninstall operations are committed only after successful reinstallation
- Failed installations trigger rollback of any preceding uninstall operation
