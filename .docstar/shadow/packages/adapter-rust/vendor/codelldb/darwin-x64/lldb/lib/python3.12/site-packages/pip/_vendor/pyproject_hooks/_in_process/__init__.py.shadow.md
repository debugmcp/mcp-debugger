**Primary Purpose**: Minimal `__init__.py` for the `_in_process` subpackage that provides a single utility function to locate the `_in_process.py` script file. This subpackage exists specifically because its directory is added to `sys.path` for in-process execution, and is intentionally kept minimal to avoid shadowing backend imports.

**Key Functions**:
- `_in_proc_script_path()` (L13-14 or L16-18): Returns a context manager for accessing the `_in_process.py` script file path. Implementation varies based on Python version compatibility.

**Dependencies**:
- `importlib.resources`: Core module for accessing package resources
- Uses `resources.files` (Python 3.9+) with fallback to `resources.path` (Python 3.8 compatibility)

**Architecture Pattern**:
- **Version Compatibility Strategy**: Uses try/except on `resources.files` attribute to detect Python version and provide appropriate implementation
- **Resource Access Abstraction**: Provides unified interface for script path access across Python versions

**Critical Design Constraints**:
- **Minimal Import Policy**: Subpackage deliberately kept empty to prevent shadowing modules that build backends might import
- **Path Management**: Directory added to `sys.path` for in-process script execution
- **Context Manager Return**: Both implementations return context managers, not direct paths

**Implementation Details**:
- Python 3.9+: Uses `resources.files(__package__).joinpath('_in_process.py')` wrapped in `resources.as_file()` (L17-18)
- Python 3.8: Uses legacy `resources.path(__package__, '_in_process.py')` (L14)
- Both approaches ensure proper resource cleanup through context manager protocol
