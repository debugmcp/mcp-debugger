## Purpose
Empty initialization module for pip's internal resolution package. This file serves as a Python package marker, making the `resolution` directory importable as a module within pip's internal architecture.

## Structure
- **File Type**: Package initialization file (`__init__.py`)
- **Content**: Empty (no code, classes, or functions defined)
- **Location**: Deep within pip's vendored dependencies for the CodeLLDB adapter

## Architectural Context
This file is part of pip's dependency resolution subsystem, likely containing resolvers and dependency management logic in sibling modules. The empty nature suggests the package exports are handled through explicit imports rather than automatic namespace exposure.

## Dependencies
None directly imported in this file.

## Key Characteristics
- No executable code
- No imports or exports
- Pure package structure marker
- Part of pip's internal (non-public) API
