This directory contains the deprecated `pkg_resources` Python package, a legacy resource management system that has been superseded by modern alternatives like `importlib.resources`, `importlib.metadata`, and the `packaging` library.

## Overall Purpose

The `pkg_resources` module provides comprehensive APIs for:
- Accessing package data files and resources embedded in Python packages
- Discovering and dynamically loading entry points advertised by packages
- Managing Python distributions (packages) and their metadata
- Resolving complex dependency chains between packages
- Supporting various package formats including eggs, wheels, and standard installations

## Core Architecture

The system is built around several interconnected components that work together to provide a unified view of the Python package ecosystem:

**Central Management**: The `WorkingSet` class serves as the primary orchestrator, maintaining a collection of all active distributions on `sys.path`. It handles distribution discovery, dependency resolution through the `require()` and `resolve()` methods, and ensures package activation in the correct order.

**Distribution Representation**: `Distribution` objects represent individual Python packages with their metadata, version information, dependencies, and entry points. Specialized subclasses (`EggInfoDistribution`, `DistInfoDistribution`) handle different metadata formats while maintaining a consistent interface.

**Resource Access**: The `ResourceManager` and provider classes (`NullProvider`, `DefaultProvider`, `ZipProvider`) form an adapter system that abstracts resource access across different package formats and storage mechanisms (filesystem, zip files, eggs).

**Environment Scanning**: The `Environment` class provides searchable snapshots of available distributions, enabling efficient package discovery and version matching through methods like `best_match()`.

## Public API Surface

**Primary Entry Points**:
- `require(requirements)` - Ensure dependencies are available and activated
- `get_distribution(requirement)` - Retrieve distribution objects for packages
- `resource_string/stream/filename()` - Access package data files
- `iter_entry_points()` - Discover and load plugin entry points
- `parse_requirements()` - Parse requirement specifications

**Key Classes for External Use**:
- `WorkingSet` - Package collection management
- `Distribution` - Individual package representation  
- `Requirement` - Dependency specification wrapper
- `EntryPoint` - Plugin loading mechanism

## Internal Organization

The module uses an adapter pattern extensively via `_find_adapter()` to map different Python import mechanisms (PEP 302 loaders) to appropriate resource providers and distribution finders. Global registries (`_provider_factories`, `_distribution_finders`, `_namespace_handlers`) maintain the mapping between loader types and their handlers.

Data flows from filesystem scanning through distribution discovery, metadata parsing, dependency resolution, and finally resource access or entry point loading. The system maintains lazy evaluation for expensive operations and preserves `sys.path` ordering for distribution precedence.

## Important Patterns

- **Backward Compatibility**: Extensive fallback mechanisms for invalid version specifications and legacy package formats
- **Platform Abstraction**: Unified resource naming (forward slashes) regardless of operating system
- **Namespace Package Support**: Special handling to maintain `__path__` consistency across namespace packages
- **Error Hierarchy**: Structured exception system (`ResolutionError`, `VersionConflict`, `DistributionNotFound`) for precise error handling

## Deprecation Status

While officially deprecated with warnings directing users to modern alternatives, `pkg_resources` remains widely deployed due to setuptools dependencies and existing codebases. The module continues to function but should be migrated away from in new projects.
