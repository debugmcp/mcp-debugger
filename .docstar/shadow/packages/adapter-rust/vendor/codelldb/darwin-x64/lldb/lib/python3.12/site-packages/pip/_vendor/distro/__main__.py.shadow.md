## Primary Purpose
Entry point module that enables the `distro` package to be executed as a script via `python -m pip._vendor.distro`. This is a standard Python executable module pattern.

## Key Components
- **Main execution block (L3-4)**: Standard `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard that calls the main function when the module is executed directly
- **Import statement (L1)**: Imports the `main` function from the sibling `distro` module using relative import

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: `.distro.main` - The actual implementation of the command-line interface

## Architectural Pattern
Follows Python's standard executable module pattern where `__main__.py` serves as a thin entry point that delegates to the actual implementation. This allows the package to be invoked with `python -m distro` while keeping the main logic in a separate module.

## Execution Flow
1. When executed as a script, imports `main` function from `distro` module
2. Immediately calls `main()` to start the application

This is a minimal, standard Python entry point with no business logic of its own.
