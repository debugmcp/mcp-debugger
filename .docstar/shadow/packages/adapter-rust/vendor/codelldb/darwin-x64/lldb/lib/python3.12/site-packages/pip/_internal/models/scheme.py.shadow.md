## Primary Purpose
Defines the `Scheme` dataclass for pip's internal package installation directory structure. This model represents the standardized paths where different types of Python package artifacts are installed.

## Key Components

### Constants
- `SCHEME_KEYS` (L10): List defining the five standard installation directory types: `["platlib", "purelib", "headers", "scripts", "data"]`

### Classes
- `Scheme` (L13-25): Frozen dataclass representing installation directory paths
  - **Fields**: All string paths for different artifact types:
    - `platlib` (L21): Platform-specific library files
    - `purelib` (L22): Pure Python library files  
    - `headers` (L23): C header files
    - `scripts` (L24): Executable scripts
    - `data` (L25): Data files
  - **Design**: Uses `__slots__` optimization (L19) and frozen=True for immutability
  - **Purpose**: Provides structured access to installation paths following Python's standard installation schemes

## Dependencies
- `dataclasses.dataclass`: For creating the immutable data structure

## Architectural Notes
- Follows Python's standard installation scheme as documented in PEP 427 and installation documentation
- Immutable design prevents accidental modification of critical path information
- Slot optimization reduces memory overhead for frequently created instances
- All paths stored as strings, requiring validation/resolution at usage sites
