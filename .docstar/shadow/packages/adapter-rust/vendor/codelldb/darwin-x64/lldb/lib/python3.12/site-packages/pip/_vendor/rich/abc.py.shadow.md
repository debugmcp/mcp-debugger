## Purpose
Abstract base class defining the Rich renderable protocol for type checking and duck typing in the Rich terminal library.

## Core Components

### RichRenderable (L4-18)
Abstract base class that implements protocol checking for Rich renderables using duck typing rather than inheritance.

**Key Method:**
- `__subclasshook__(cls, other: type) -> bool` (L15-18): Classmethod that enables `isinstance()` checks by detecting presence of `__rich_console__` or `__rich__` methods on objects, implementing the Rich renderable protocol without requiring inheritance.

## Protocol Definition
Objects are considered Rich renderables if they implement either:
- `__rich_console__` method (primary rendering interface)  
- `__rich__` method (legacy/simple rendering interface)

## Usage Pattern
Designed for type checking rather than inheritance:
```python
if isinstance(my_object, RichRenderable):
    console.print(my_object)
```

## Dependencies
- `abc.ABC` - Python's abstract base class infrastructure
- `pip._vendor.rich.text.Text` - Only in test code (L22)

## Architecture Notes
- Uses Python's `__subclasshook__` mechanism to enable protocol-based type checking
- Follows structural typing principles - objects are compatible based on interface rather than inheritance
- Part of Rich's broader ecosystem for terminal rendering and formatting
