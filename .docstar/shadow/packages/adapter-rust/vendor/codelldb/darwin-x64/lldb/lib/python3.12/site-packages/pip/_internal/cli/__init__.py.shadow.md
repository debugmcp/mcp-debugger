**Purpose**: Package initialization module for pip's command line interface subsystem. Serves as the entry point to pip's CLI-related functionality.

**Key Components**:
- Module docstring (L1-2): Describes the subpackage's role in containing all CLI-related code
- Intentional import restriction (L4): Explicitly avoids importing submodules at package level

**Architecture Pattern**: 
- Uses lazy loading pattern by intentionally not importing submodules at initialization
- This prevents circular imports and reduces startup overhead
- Submodules must be explicitly imported when needed by consumers

**Dependencies**: None (intentionally minimal)

**Design Constraints**:
- Import restriction is architectural decision to avoid dependency issues
- Package serves purely as namespace organizer rather than functional module
