## Purpose
Custom logging infrastructure for pip's internal operations, extending Python's standard logging with a VERBOSE level between INFO and DEBUG for detailed command-line output control.

## Key Components

### Constants
- `VERBOSE = 15` (L13): Custom log level positioned between DEBUG (10) and INFO (20)

### Classes
- `VerboseLogger` (L16-23): Extends `logging.Logger` with verbose() method
  - `verbose()` (L22): Logs messages at VERBOSE level, accepts same arguments as standard log methods

### Functions
- `getLogger(name: str)` (L26-28): Drop-in replacement for `logging.getLogger()` that ensures VerboseLogger instances are returned via type casting
- `init_logging()` (L31-38): Initialization function that registers VerboseLogger class and VERBOSE level name with Python's logging system

## Dependencies
- `logging`: Python standard library for logging functionality
- `typing`: For type annotations (Any, cast)

## Usage Pattern
1. Call `init_logging()` before any logging operations (typically in `pip._internal.__init__`)
2. Use `getLogger(name)` instead of `logging.getLogger(name)` to get VerboseLogger instances
3. Access verbose logging via `logger.verbose(message)` for intermediate verbosity

## Critical Constraints
- `init_logging()` must be called before any `getLogger()` calls to ensure proper logger class registration
- VERBOSE level (15) provides granularity between standard INFO and DEBUG levels for pip's `--verbose` flag
