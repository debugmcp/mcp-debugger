**Purpose:** Empty Python module file that serves as a package marker for pip's resolvelib resolution implementation.

**Structure:** This is an empty `__init__.py` file with no content, classes, functions, or imports.

**Role in Architecture:** 
- Marks the `pip/_internal/resolution/resolvelib/` directory as a Python package
- Enables imports from submodules within the resolvelib resolution package
- Part of pip's dependency resolution system that likely uses the ResolveLib library

**Dependencies:** None (empty file)

**Key Components:** None - file contains no code

**Architectural Notes:**
- Common Python pattern for package initialization
- Actual resolution logic likely implemented in sibling modules within this package
- Follows pip's internal modular architecture for dependency resolution backends
