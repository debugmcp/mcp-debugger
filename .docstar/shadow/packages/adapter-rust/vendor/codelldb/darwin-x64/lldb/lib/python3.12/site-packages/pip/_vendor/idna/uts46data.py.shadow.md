**IDNA UTS46 Unicode Data Table - Auto-Generated Mapping File**

Primary purpose: Contains a comprehensive Unicode character mapping table for IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) conforming to UTS46 specification. This file provides normalization and validation data for international domain name processing.

## Key Components

**Version Information (L10):**
- `__version__ = '15.1.0'` - Unicode version identifier

**Segment Functions (L11-8597):**
- `_seg_0() -> _seg_81()` - 82 individual functions that each return mapping data for different Unicode ranges
- Each function returns `List[Union[Tuple[int, str], Tuple[int, str, str]]]`
- Tuples contain: (codepoint, status) or (codepoint, status, replacement_text)

**Status Codes Used:**
- `'V'` - Valid character (unchanged)
- `'M'` - Mapped character (with replacement text)
- `'3'` - Deviation character (context-dependent)
- `'X'` - Disallowed character
- `'I'` - Ignored character
- `'D'` - Deviation (mapped or valid based on transitional processing)

**Main Data Structure (L8515-8598):**
- `uts46data` - Master tuple combining all segment data into a single comprehensive mapping table
- Contains mappings for the full Unicode range up to U+E01F0
- Each entry maps a Unicode codepoint to its IDNA processing behavior

## Architecture

The file uses a segmented approach to manage the large dataset:
- Data is split across 82 functions to avoid Python constraints on large literals
- Functions are concatenated at module load time into the final `uts46data` tuple
- Covers extensive Unicode ranges including CJK ideographs, emoji, mathematical symbols, and all major scripts

## Usage Context

This is a generated data file (L1 comment) used by IDNA processing libraries to:
- Normalize international domain names
- Validate domain name characters according to UTS46
- Handle Unicode case folding and character mapping for DNS compatibility
- Support both transitional and non-transitional IDNA processing modes

The data enables proper handling of international characters in domain names, ensuring consistent processing across different systems and applications.
