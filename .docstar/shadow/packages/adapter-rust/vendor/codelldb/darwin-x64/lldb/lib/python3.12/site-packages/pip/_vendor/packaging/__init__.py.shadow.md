This is the package metadata initialization file for the `packaging` library, a core Python utility for package management operations.

**Purpose:** Defines package-level metadata constants that identify the library version, authorship, and licensing information.

**Key Metadata Constants:**
- `__title__` (L5): Package name "packaging"
- `__summary__` (L6): Brief description of package purpose
- `__uri__` (L7): GitHub repository URL for the PyPA packaging project
- `__version__` (L9): Current version "24.1"
- `__author__` (L11): Primary maintainer Donald Stufft
- `__email__` (L12): Maintainer contact email
- `__license__` (L14): Dual license (BSD-2-Clause or Apache-2.0)
- `__copyright__` (L15): Copyright notice with dynamic year formatting

**Context:** This file is located within pip's vendored dependencies (`pip/_vendor/packaging`), indicating it's a bundled copy of the packaging library used internally by pip. The packaging library provides utilities for parsing version strings, requirements specifications, and other package metadata operations.

**Architecture Notes:** Standard Python package metadata pattern using dunder variables that can be imported and used by setup tools, documentation generators, and runtime introspection.
