**Purpose**: Implements reporter classes for pip's dependency resolution process, providing user feedback during package backtracking and debugging capabilities.

**Core Classes**:

- **PipReporter (L12-55)**: Main reporter that tracks candidate rejections and provides progressive user feedback during slow resolution
  - `reject_count_by_package` (L14): Tracks rejection counts per package name
  - `_messages_at_reject_count` (L16-33): Maps rejection thresholds (1, 8, 13) to escalating user messages
  - `rejecting_candidate()` (L35-55): Core method that increments rejection counts and logs appropriate messages based on thresholds

- **PipDebuggingReporter (L58-80)**: Verbose reporter for debugging that logs all resolution events
  - Implements full BaseReporter interface with info-level logging
  - Methods: `starting()`, `starting_round()`, `ending_round()`, `ending()`, `adding_requirement()`, `rejecting_candidate()`, `pinning()`

**Key Dependencies**:
- `pip._vendor.resolvelib.reporters.BaseReporter`: Parent class defining reporter interface
- `.base.Candidate, Requirement`: Core resolution types
- Standard logging infrastructure

**Notable Patterns**:
- Progressive messaging strategy: Provides increasingly urgent messages as backtracking continues (1 → 8 → 13 rejections)
- Conflict explanation: Builds detailed dependency chain messages showing why candidates are rejected
- Separation of concerns: PipReporter for user experience, PipDebuggingReporter for development

**Critical Behavior**:
- Message formatting uses `candidate.name` for package identification
- Debug messages include full dependency chain context
- Hardcoded rejection count thresholds trigger specific user guidance
- References external documentation for backtracking guidance (L30)
