This file appears to be an empty Python package initializer for pip's legacy resolution system. 

**Purpose**: Defines the `pip._internal.resolution.legacy` package namespace, likely serving as a marker for the legacy dependency resolution implementation within pip's internal architecture.

**Package Structure**: Part of pip's internal resolution system hierarchy, specifically the legacy resolver branch. The legacy resolver represents pip's older dependency resolution algorithm, maintained alongside newer resolvers for backward compatibility.

**Dependencies**: No explicit imports or dependencies present.

**Architectural Context**: This empty `__init__.py` indicates the legacy resolution package contains implementation modules that are imported elsewhere. The legacy resolver likely contrasts with newer resolver implementations in sibling packages.

**Critical Notes**: The empty state suggests this is purely a namespace package marker. The actual legacy resolution logic would be implemented in submodules within this package directory.
