## Purpose
Vendored text processing utilities from `jaraco.text` to support `pkg_resources` without pulling in the entire `jaraco.text` dependency tree. Part of pip's internal vendoring strategy to avoid complex dependency management.

## Key Functions

### `_nonblank(str)` (L36-37)
Internal helper that filters out empty strings and lines starting with `#`. Used by `yield_lines` for comment filtering.

### `yield_lines(iterable)` (L40-61) 
**Core function** - Single-dispatch generic that processes strings or iterables into clean lines:
- Base implementation (L41-56): Recursively processes iterables using `itertools.chain.from_iterable`
- String specialization (L59-61): Splits text on newlines, strips whitespace, filters non-blank lines
- Handles mixed string/iterable inputs, removes comment lines starting with `#`

### `drop_comment(line)` (L64-76)
Removes trailing comments from lines, but only when preceded by space to avoid breaking URLs with fragments. Uses `str.partition(" #")` for clean splitting.

### `join_continuation(lines)` (L79-109)
Processes line continuation backslashes by joining continued lines:
- Strips the character before `\` and the `\` itself (L106)
- Handles nested continuations iteratively
- Suppresses incomplete continuations at end of input (L107-108)
- Returns generator for memory efficiency

## Dependencies
- `functools` - for `@singledispatch` decorator
- `itertools` - for `chain.from_iterable` in recursive line processing

## Architectural Notes
- Uses single-dispatch pattern for polymorphic `yield_lines` behavior
- All functions are generators/lazy where possible for memory efficiency
- Designed as drop-in replacements for `jaraco.text` functions
- MIT licensed code from Jason R. Coombs

## Usage Context
These utilities support pip's package metadata parsing, particularly for processing requirements files and package configuration that may contain line continuations and comments.
