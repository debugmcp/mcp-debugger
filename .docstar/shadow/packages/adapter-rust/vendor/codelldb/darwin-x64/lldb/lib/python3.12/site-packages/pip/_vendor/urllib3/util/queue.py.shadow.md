## Purpose
Custom LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) queue implementation for urllib3's connection pooling, extending Python's standard queue with stack-like behavior.

## Key Components
- **LifoQueue (L11-22)**: Main class implementing LIFO queue semantics by overriding Queue's internal methods
  - `_init()` (L12-13): Initializes internal storage using collections.deque
  - `_qsize()` (L15-16): Returns queue size, optimized with local len reference
  - `_put()` (L18-19): Adds items to end of deque (append operation)
  - `_get()` (L21-22): Removes and returns last item (pop operation)

## Dependencies
- `collections.deque`: Core data structure providing efficient append/pop operations
- `six`: Python 2/3 compatibility layer (L3)
- `queue.Queue`: Base class providing thread-safe queue interface (L4)
- Legacy Python 2 Queue import for Windows compatibility (L6-8)

## Architecture
Implements template method pattern by overriding Queue's protected methods (`_init`, `_qsize`, `_put`, `_get`) while inheriting thread-safety mechanisms from parent class. Uses deque for O(1) operations at both ends.

## Usage Context
Designed for connection pool management where most recently created connections should be reused first (LIFO), promoting connection locality and reducing resource churn.
