## Purpose
Represents already-installed Python packages in pip's distribution system. This is a no-op implementation since installed packages require no preparation or metadata computation.

## Key Components
- **InstalledDistribution (L8-29)**: Concrete implementation of AbstractDistribution for packages that are already installed on the system
  - **build_tracker_id property (L15-17)**: Always returns None since installed packages don't need build tracking
  - **get_metadata_distribution() (L19-21)**: Returns the satisfied requirement's metadata, asserting the package is actually installed
  - **prepare_distribution_metadata() (L23-29)**: No-op method since installed packages need no preparation

## Dependencies
- Inherits from `AbstractDistribution` (pip._internal.distributions.base)
- Uses `BaseDistribution` metadata interface (pip._internal.metadata)
- Accepts `PackageFinder` parameter but doesn't use it

## Architecture Pattern
Implements the Null Object pattern for distribution preparation - installed packages bypass the typical build/preparation pipeline since their metadata is already available through `self.req.satisfied_by`.

## Key Invariant
The requirement (`self.req`) must have a `satisfied_by` attribute that is not None, indicating the package is actually installed on the system.
