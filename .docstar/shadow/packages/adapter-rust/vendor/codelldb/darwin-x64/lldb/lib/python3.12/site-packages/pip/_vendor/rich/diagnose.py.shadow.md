This is a diagnostic utility module for the Rich terminal library, specifically designed to collect and display debugging information about the terminal environment.

**Primary Purpose**: Provides system and environment diagnostics for troubleshooting Rich console rendering issues, particularly useful when terminal features aren't working as expected.

**Key Functions**:
- `report()` (L10-34): Main diagnostic function that prints comprehensive environment information to the terminal. Creates a Console instance, inspects it along with Windows console features, collects relevant environment variables, and displays platform information.

**Dependencies**:
- `os`, `platform`: Standard library modules for system information
- `pip._vendor.rich.inspect`: For object inspection capabilities
- `pip._vendor.rich.console.Console`: Main console interface
- `pip._vendor.rich.console.get_windows_console_features`: Windows-specific feature detection
- `pip._vendor.rich.panel.Panel`: For styled output panels
- `pip._vendor.rich.pretty.Pretty`: For formatted object display

**Key Data**:
- `env_names` tuple (L17-29): Comprehensive list of environment variables that affect terminal behavior including color support (TERM, COLORTERM, CLICOLOR, NO_COLOR), terminal programs (TERM_PROGRAM), dimensions (COLUMNS, LINES), Jupyter-specific vars (JUPYTER_COLUMNS, JUPYTER_LINES, JPY_PARENT_PID), and VSCode logging (VSCODE_VERBOSE_LOGGING).

**Output Structure**:
1. Console object inspection details
2. Windows console features (if applicable)  
3. Environment variables in a fitted panel
4. Platform system name

**Usage Pattern**: Can be run as standalone script (L36-37) or imported and called programmatically. Designed for debugging terminal rendering issues and gathering environment context for bug reports.
