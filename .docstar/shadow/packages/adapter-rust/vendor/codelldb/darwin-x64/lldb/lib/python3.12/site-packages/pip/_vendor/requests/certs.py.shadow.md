## Primary Purpose
Certificate authority (CA) bundle location provider for the requests library within a pip vendor context. Abstracts the source of SSL/TLS certificates to enable flexible CA bundle management in different deployment scenarios.

## Key Components

**where() function (L18 or L20-21)**: Core function that returns the path to the CA certificate bundle. Implementation varies based on environment:
- **Standard mode (L18)**: Delegates to `pip._vendor.certifi.where()` to use the bundled certifi certificates
- **Standalone mode (L20-21)**: Returns custom CA bundle path from `_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT` environment variable

**Environment detection (L17)**: Conditional logic that checks for `_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT` environment variable to determine certificate source strategy.

**CLI interface (L23-24)**: Simple command-line entry point that prints the current CA bundle path when module is executed directly.

## Dependencies
- **os module (L15)**: For environment variable access
- **pip._vendor.certifi (L18)**: Vendored certifi package providing Mozilla's CA bundle (conditionally imported)

## Architectural Decisions
- **Environment-based configuration**: Uses environment variable to override default certificate source, enabling deployment flexibility
- **Lazy imports**: Conditional import of certifi only when not in standalone mode
- **Vendor namespace**: Located in pip's vendor directory, indicating this is a vendored copy of the requests library

## Critical Constraints
- The `_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT` environment variable must point to a valid CA bundle file when in standalone mode
- Function signature of `where()` must remain consistent regardless of implementation path
- Module serves as abstraction layer - changing certificate sources should not break dependent code
