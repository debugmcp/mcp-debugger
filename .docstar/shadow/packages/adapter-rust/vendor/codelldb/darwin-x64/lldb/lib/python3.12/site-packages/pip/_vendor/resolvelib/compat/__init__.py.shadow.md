## Purpose
Empty initialization module for the resolvelib.compat package. This file serves as a package marker to make the `compat` directory a proper Python package within the pip vendored resolvelib library.

## Structure
- **File Location**: Part of pip's vendored resolvelib dependency resolution library
- **Package Role**: Compatibility layer package initializer
- **Content**: Empty file with no executable code

## Dependencies
None - this is a bare package initializer.

## Architectural Context
Located within pip's vendor directory structure, this package likely contains compatibility utilities for resolvelib's dependency resolution across different Python versions or environments. The empty `__init__.py` follows Python's package structure conventions.

## Key Points
- No classes, functions, or variables defined
- Serves purely as package structure marker
- Part of pip's internal vendored dependencies
- Enables import of compatibility utilities from sibling modules
