## Purpose
Empty Python package initialization file for pip's internal operations module. Serves as a namespace marker to make the `operations` directory a valid Python package.

## Structure
- **File type**: Empty `__init__.py` file
- **Location**: `packages/adapter-rust/vendor/codelldb/darwin-x64/lldb/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_internal/operations/`
- **Function**: Package namespace declaration only

## Context
Part of pip's internal package structure within a vendored LLDB Python environment. The operations package likely contains modules for pip's core functionality like installation, uninstallation, and package management operations.

## Dependencies
None - file contains no imports or code.

## Notes
This is a standard Python package marker file with no implementation. Other modules in the operations package would contain the actual operational logic.
