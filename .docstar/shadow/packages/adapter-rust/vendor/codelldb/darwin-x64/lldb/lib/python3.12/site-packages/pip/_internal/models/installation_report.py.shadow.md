This module defines the InstallationReport class which generates structured installation reports for pip package installations following PEP standards.

## Primary Purpose
Creates JSON-serializable reports documenting package installations, including metadata, download information, and environment details for compliance with PEP 610, PEP 566, and PEP 592.

## Key Classes and Functions

### InstallationReport (L9-56)
Main class that encapsulates installation reporting functionality.

**Constructor (L10-11)**: Takes a sequence of InstallRequirement objects representing packages to report on.

**_install_req_to_dict (L14-40)**: Class method that converts a single InstallRequirement to a dictionary containing:
- `download_info`: PEP 610 compliant download URL information (L21)
- `is_direct`: Boolean indicating if requirement was a direct URL reference (L25)
- `is_yanked`: Boolean for PEP 592 yanked package compliance (L28)
- `requested`: Boolean indicating user-supplied vs dependency (L32)
- `metadata`: PEP 566 JSON metadata encoding (L35)
- `requested_extras`: Optional list of extras for top-level requirements (L37-39)

**to_dict (L42-56)**: Generates the complete installation report dictionary with:
- Report version identifier ("1")
- Current pip version
- Array of installation entries
- Environment markers following PEP 508

## Dependencies
- `pip._vendor.packaging.markers.default_environment`: For environment marker evaluation
- `pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement`: Core requirement objects
- `pip.__version__`: Version information

## Architectural Patterns
- Uses class method for requirement serialization to maintain separation of concerns
- Follows PEP compliance standards for structured metadata reporting
- Implements defensive programming with assertions (L15)

## Critical Constraints
- Requires InstallRequirement objects to have populated download_info
- Environment reporting currently uses default environment only (future enhancement needed for custom environments)
