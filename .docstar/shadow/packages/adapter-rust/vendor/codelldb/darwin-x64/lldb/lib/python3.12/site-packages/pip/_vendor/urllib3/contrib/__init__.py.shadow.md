## Purpose
Empty Python package initialization file for the `pip._vendor.urllib3.contrib` module. This file serves as a namespace marker to make the `contrib` directory a valid Python package, allowing imports of contributed/optional urllib3 extensions.

## Structure
- **File Type**: Package initializer (`__init__.py`)
- **Content**: Empty file (0 lines of actual code)
- **Role**: Enables Python to treat the `contrib` directory as an importable package

## Context
Located within pip's vendored copy of urllib3, this contrib package typically contains optional/experimental features and third-party integrations for urllib3, such as:
- Alternative connection pooling implementations
- Security-related extensions (SecureTransport, AppEngine adapters)
- Specialized HTTP adapters

The empty nature of this file indicates that contrib modules are imported explicitly rather than being auto-imported at package level.
