**Purpose**: Defines exit status codes for pip's command-line interface operations.

**Key Constants**:
- `SUCCESS` (L1): Standard success exit code (0)
- `ERROR` (L2): Generic error exit code (1) 
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` (L3): Unspecified error condition (2)
- `VIRTUALENV_NOT_FOUND` (L4): Virtual environment lookup failure (3)
- `PREVIOUS_BUILD_DIR_ERROR` (L5): Build directory conflict/corruption (4)
- `NO_MATCHES_FOUND` (L6): Search/query returned no results (23)

**Usage Pattern**: These constants provide standardized exit codes for pip CLI commands, enabling shell scripts and automation tools to programmatically interpret pip operation outcomes. The non-sequential numbering (jumping from 4 to 23) suggests this is part of a larger status code schema with reserved ranges.

**Dependencies**: None - pure constant definitions.

**Architectural Role**: Central status code registry for pip's CLI layer, promoting consistent error reporting across the application.
