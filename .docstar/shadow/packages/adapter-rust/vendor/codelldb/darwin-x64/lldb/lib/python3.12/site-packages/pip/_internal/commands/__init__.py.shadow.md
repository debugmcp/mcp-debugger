## Purpose
Command registry and factory module for pip's internal command system. Provides centralized command discovery, instantiation, and auto-correction functionality.

## Key Components

### Data Structures
- **CommandInfo** (L11): Named tuple containing `(module_path, class_name, summary)` for command metadata
- **commands_dict** (L20-106): Central registry mapping command names to CommandInfo instances, defining all available pip commands with their module paths, class names, and descriptions

### Command Registry
The commands_dict contains 17 pip commands including:
- Core package operations: install, download, uninstall, freeze (L21-40)
- Information commands: inspect, list, show, check (L41-60) 
- Configuration and search: config, search, cache, index (L61-80)
- Build and utility: wheel, hash, completion, debug, help (L81-105)

### Functions
- **create_command()** (L109-118): Factory function that dynamically imports and instantiates command classes based on name lookup in commands_dict
- **get_similar_commands()** (L121-132): Auto-correction function using difflib to suggest similar command names for typos

## Dependencies
- `importlib`: For dynamic module loading in command instantiation
- `collections.namedtuple`: For CommandInfo structure
- `difflib.get_close_matches`: For command name suggestions
- `pip._internal.cli.base_command.Command`: Base command class interface

## Architectural Patterns
- **Registry Pattern**: commands_dict serves as a centralized command registry
- **Factory Pattern**: create_command() provides dynamic command instantiation
- **Lazy Loading**: Commands are only imported when needed, avoiding costly upfront imports
- **Auto-correction**: Built-in typo tolerance for better UX

## Critical Invariants
- Command names in commands_dict must match actual module/class names
- Module paths must be importable at runtime
- All command classes must inherit from base Command class
- Command ordering in dict affects help display output
