## Overall Purpose
The `resolvelib` directory contains a complete dependency resolution library that implements sophisticated constraint solving algorithms for package managers. As part of pip's vendored dependencies, this library provides the core dependency resolution engine used by pip to solve complex package dependency graphs with conflict detection, backtracking, and optimization.

## Key Components and Architecture

### Core Resolution Engine
- **`resolvers.py`**: Contains the main `Resolver` class and `Resolution` engine that implements a backtracking algorithm with conflict resolution. Uses sophisticated state management and backjumping to efficiently navigate dependency constraint spaces.
- **`structs.py`**: Provides essential data structures including `DirectedGraph` for dependency relationships, `IteratorMapping` for combining multiple data sources, and iterator utilities for lazy evaluation.

### Abstract Interface Layer
- **`providers.py`**: Defines `AbstractProvider` and `AbstractResolver` base classes that establish the provider-resolver pattern. Providers supply domain-specific dependency information while resolvers orchestrate the generic resolution algorithm.
- **`reporters.py`**: Provides `BaseReporter` interface for monitoring resolution progress through lifecycle hooks, enabling external observers to track resolution events without coupling to internal implementation.

### Support Infrastructure
- **`compat/`**: Compatibility layer handling Python version differences, particularly for abstract base classes (`Mapping`, `Sequence`) across Python 2/3 transitions.
- **`__init__.py`**: Package entry point exposing the complete public API surface with version information.

## Public API Surface

### Main Entry Points
- **`Resolver`**: Primary resolution engine class accepting provider and reporter instances
- **`AbstractProvider`**: Base class for implementing custom dependency data sources
- **`BaseReporter`**: Base class for tracking resolution progress

### Exception Hierarchy
- **`ResolutionError`**: Base exception for resolution failures
- **`ResolutionImpossible`**: No valid solution exists for given constraints
- **`ResolutionTooDeep`**: Resolution exceeded maximum iteration depth
- **`RequirementsConflicted`**: Conflicting requirements detected
- **`InconsistentCandidate`**: Invalid candidate state encountered

## Internal Organization and Data Flow

1. **Provider Integration**: External systems implement `AbstractProvider` to supply dependency metadata, candidate discovery, and constraint validation
2. **Resolution Process**: `Resolver` orchestrates dependency resolution using provider services, maintaining resolution state and handling conflicts through backtracking
3. **Progress Monitoring**: `BaseReporter` implementations receive lifecycle events and resolution progress updates
4. **Data Structures**: `DirectedGraph` manages dependency relationships while specialized iterators handle lazy evaluation and data composition
5. **Result Generation**: Resolution produces comprehensive results including final package mappings, dependency graphs, and detailed criteria

## Important Patterns and Conventions

- **Provider-Resolver Pattern**: Clean separation between domain-specific dependency logic (providers) and generic resolution algorithms (resolvers)
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Systematic exploration of solution space with intelligent backjumping when conflicts arise
- **Immutable State Design**: Resolution state objects are externally immutable to ensure consistency during backtracking
- **Observer Pattern**: Reporter interface enables monitoring without coupling to resolution internals
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Iterator-based design preserves performance through deferred computation
- **Abstract Interface Design**: Extensive use of abstract base classes enables pluggable implementations for different package ecosystems

This library serves as the algorithmic foundation for pip's dependency resolution, providing a robust, extensible framework that can handle complex real-world package dependency scenarios while maintaining clean architectural boundaries.
