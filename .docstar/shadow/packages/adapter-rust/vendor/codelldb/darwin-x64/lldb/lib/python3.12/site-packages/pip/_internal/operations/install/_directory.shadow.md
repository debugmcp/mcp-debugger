## Overall Purpose
This directory implements pip's core package installation operations, providing the machinery to install Python packages from various sources (wheels and editable packages). It serves as the execution layer that transforms package metadata and source files into properly installed packages within Python environments.

## Key Components and Relationships

### Installation Strategies
- **`wheel.py`**: Primary installation engine for wheel packages, handling the complete installation pipeline from wheel extraction to metadata recording
- **`editable_legacy.py`**: Legacy pathway for editable installations using `setup.py develop`, maintaining backward compatibility for older package formats

### Installation Flow Integration
The components work together to provide comprehensive package installation:

1. **Entry Point**: The package is initialized through `__init__.py`, establishing the namespace for installation operations
2. **Format Detection**: Installation strategy is selected based on package format (wheel vs legacy editable)
3. **Execution**: Either `install_wheel()` for wheel packages or `install_editable()` for development installations
4. **Common Infrastructure**: Both pathways share underlying utilities for subprocess execution, build environments, and logging

## Public API Surface

### Primary Entry Points
- **`install_wheel()`**: Main interface for wheel installation with error context management
- **`install_editable()`**: Entry point for legacy editable installations using setuptools develop

### Key Installation Parameters
Both entry points accept standardized configuration:
- Installation locations (`prefix`, `home`, `use_user_site`)
- Build environment context and isolation settings
- Global options and metadata recording preferences

## Internal Organization and Data Flow

### Wheel Installation Pipeline
1. **Metadata Processing**: Parse wheel structure and determine installation directories (purelib/platlib)
2. **File Extraction**: Extract wheel contents with path traversal protection and permission handling
3. **Script Generation**: Create entry point scripts with proper shebang resolution
4. **Metadata Recording**: Generate installation records (INSTALLER, REQUESTED, RECORD files)
5. **Integrity Verification**: Compute file hashes and track installation state

### Legacy Editable Installation
1. **Command Construction**: Build setuptools develop arguments using shared utilities
2. **Environment Isolation**: Execute within controlled build environment
3. **Subprocess Management**: Run `python setup.py develop` with proper error handling

## Important Patterns and Conventions

### Error Handling Strategy
- Context managers for enriching installation errors with requirement details
- Path traversal protection throughout file operations
- Subprocess isolation within build environments

### File System Management
- Consistent path handling between filesystem and RECORD format
- Permission preservation for executable files
- Safe file extraction with security checks

### Script Handling
- Shebang line normalization for cross-platform compatibility
- Entry point validation and script maker customization
- Special handling for pip/setuptools scripts based on environment variables

### Logging and Output
- Indented logging context for structured output
- Progress tracking and user feedback for long-running operations
- Warning generation for common configuration issues (PATH visibility)

This directory represents pip's installation execution layer, abstracting the complexity of package installation while providing robust error handling and cross-platform compatibility.
