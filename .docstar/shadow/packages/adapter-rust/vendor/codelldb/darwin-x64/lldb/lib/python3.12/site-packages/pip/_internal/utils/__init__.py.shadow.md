## Primary Purpose
Empty package initialization file for pip's internal utilities module. Serves as a namespace package marker to make the `utils` directory a valid Python package within pip's internal structure.

## Structure
- Empty file with no classes, functions, or imports
- Acts as package boundary for pip's internal utility modules
- Located in pip's internal utilities package hierarchy: `pip._internal.utils`

## Architectural Role
This `__init__.py` file enables the `utils` directory to be treated as a Python package, allowing other modules to import utilities from `pip._internal.utils.*`. The empty implementation suggests that utility functions are organized in separate modules within this package rather than exposed at the package level.

## Dependencies
No direct dependencies or imports present.

## Usage Context
Part of pip's internal package structure - this utilities package likely contains helper modules for various pip operations (networking, filesystem operations, dependency resolution, etc.) that are imported by other pip components.
