**Primary Purpose**: Provides an abstraction layer for paginated content display, allowing Rich to show large outputs through system-installed pagers.

**Core Components**:

- `Pager` (L5-15): Abstract base class defining the pager interface with a single required method `show()` that takes string content and displays it through a paging mechanism.

- `SystemPager` (L17-25): Concrete implementation that delegates to Python's built-in `pydoc.pager()` functionality. Uses dynamic import via `__import__()` in `_pager()` method (L20-21) to avoid import-time dependencies.

**Key Dependencies**:
- `abc` module for abstract base class functionality
- `pydoc` module (dynamically imported) for system pager integration
- Rich's internal modules (`.__main__`, `.console`) for testing

**Architectural Patterns**:
- Abstract factory pattern: `Pager` serves as interface, `SystemPager` as concrete implementation
- Lazy loading: `pydoc` imported only when needed via `__import__()`
- Separation of concerns: Private `_pager()` method handles actual paging logic

**Integration Points**:
- Designed to work with Rich's console system (evidenced by test code L32-34)
- Expected to be used through console.pager() context manager
- Content expected as pre-formatted strings

**Testing/Demo**: Main block (L28-34) demonstrates integration with Rich console using `make_test_card()` for styled output testing.

**Notable Constraints**:
- Content must be string format (no direct object rendering)
- Relies on system having compatible pager installed
- No error handling for missing/broken system pagers
