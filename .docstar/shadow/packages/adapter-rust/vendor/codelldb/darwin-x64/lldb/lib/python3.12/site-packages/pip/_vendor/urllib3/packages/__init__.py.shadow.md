**Purpose:** Empty package initialization file for urllib3 packages module.

**Primary Responsibility:** Marks the `packages` directory as a Python package, enabling import of submodules within urllib3's vendored packages.

**Content:** The file is completely empty, containing no code, imports, or documentation.

**Architectural Context:** This is part of pip's vendored copy of urllib3, located within a debugger (codelldb) distribution for Rust development. The `packages` directory likely contains vendored third-party libraries that urllib3 depends on, following the common Python pattern of vendoring dependencies to avoid version conflicts.

**Key Characteristics:**
- No classes, functions, or variables defined
- No imports or exports
- No module-level initialization code
- Serves purely as a package marker for Python's import system
