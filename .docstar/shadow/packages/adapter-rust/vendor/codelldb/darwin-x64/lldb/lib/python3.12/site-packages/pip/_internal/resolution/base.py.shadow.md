**Purpose**: Abstract base class defining the interface for pip's dependency resolution system. Establishes the contract that concrete resolvers must implement.

**Key Components**:

- **InstallRequirementProvider (L6-8)**: Type alias for a callable that takes a requirement string and optional InstallRequirement, returning an InstallRequirement object. Used for requirement provision/creation during resolution.

- **BaseResolver (L11-20)**: Abstract base class defining the resolver interface with two required methods:
  - `resolve()` (L12-15): Core resolution method taking root requirements and wheel check flag, returns a RequirementSet containing resolved dependencies
  - `get_installation_order()` (L17-20): Determines proper installation sequence from a resolved RequirementSet, returns ordered list of InstallRequirements

**Dependencies**:
- `pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement`: Core requirement representation
- `pip._internal.req.req_set.RequirementSet`: Container for resolved requirements

**Architecture Notes**:
- Uses template method pattern - subclasses must implement both abstract methods
- Separates resolution logic from installation ordering logic
- The `check_supported_wheels` parameter suggests wheel compatibility validation during resolution
- Interface supports the two-phase resolution process: dependency resolution followed by installation ordering

**Usage Context**: This base class would be extended by concrete resolvers (e.g., legacy resolver, new PEP 517 resolver) to provide actual resolution algorithms while maintaining consistent interface.
