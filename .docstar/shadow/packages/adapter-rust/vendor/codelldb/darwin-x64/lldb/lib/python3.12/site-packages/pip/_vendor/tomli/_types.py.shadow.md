## Primary Purpose
Type definition module for the tomli TOML parser library. Provides core type aliases used throughout the parser for consistent typing and function signatures.

## Key Type Definitions
- **ParseFloat (L8)**: Callable type alias for float parsing functions, takes a string and returns Any type
- **Key (L9)**: Tuple of strings representing hierarchical TOML keys (e.g., `["table", "subtable", "field"]`)  
- **Pos (L10)**: Integer type alias for position tracking during parsing

## Dependencies
- **typing module (L5)**: Uses Any, Callable, and Tuple for type annotations

## Architectural Role
This is a foundational types module that establishes the type contract for the tomli parser. The ParseFloat type enables pluggable float parsing behavior, while Key represents the dotted key paths in TOML structure. Pos provides semantic meaning for integer positions in the parsing context.

## Usage Context
These types are likely imported and used across the tomli parser codebase to maintain type safety and provide clear interfaces for parsing operations.
