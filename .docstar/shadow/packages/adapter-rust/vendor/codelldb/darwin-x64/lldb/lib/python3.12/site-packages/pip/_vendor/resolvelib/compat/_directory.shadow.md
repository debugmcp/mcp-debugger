## Overall Purpose
The `resolvelib/compat` directory serves as a compatibility layer within pip's vendored resolvelib dependency resolution library. This package provides Python version-agnostic utilities and imports to ensure resolvelib works consistently across different Python versions and environments.

## Module Organization
- **`__init__.py`**: Empty package initializer that marks the directory as a Python package
- **`collections_abc.py`**: Compatibility shim for abstract base classes, handling Python version differences

## Key Components and Relationships
The directory implements a classic Python compatibility pattern where version-specific imports are abstracted behind consistent interfaces:

- The package structure is established by the empty `__init__.py`
- `collections_abc.py` provides backward compatibility for the Python 3.3+ migration of `Mapping` and `Sequence` from `collections` to `collections.abc`
- Uses try/except ImportError pattern to gracefully handle version differences

## Public API Surface
**Main Entry Points:**
- `from resolvelib.compat.collections_abc import Mapping, Sequence`

**Exported Interfaces:**
- `Mapping`: Abstract base class for mapping types (dict-like objects)
- `Sequence`: Abstract base class for sequence types (list-like objects)

## Internal Organization and Data Flow
1. Client code imports from the compat layer
2. Compatibility modules attempt modern imports first
3. Fall back to legacy import locations if needed
4. Provide consistent API regardless of Python version

## Important Patterns and Conventions
- **Try/except ImportError pattern**: Standard approach for handling version-specific imports
- **Compatibility shim architecture**: Abstracts version differences behind stable interfaces
- **Vendor library integration**: Part of pip's strategy to bundle dependencies with compatibility layers
- **Empty package initializers**: Follows Python packaging conventions for namespace organization

This compatibility layer ensures that resolvelib's core dependency resolution logic can focus on algorithmic concerns rather than Python version compatibility, making the codebase more maintainable and robust across different deployment environments.
