**Purpose**: Implements a null object pattern for file I/O operations, providing a no-op file-like object that discards all operations safely.

**Key Components**:

- `NullFile` class (L5-67): Complete implementation of `IO[str]` interface that safely handles all file operations as no-ops
  - All read operations (`read`, `readline`, `readlines` L12-22) return empty strings/lists
  - All write operations (`write`, `writelines` L39-40, L59-60) discard input and return 0
  - Stream positioning methods (`seek`, `tell` L24-31) always return 0
  - Capability queries (`readable`, `writable`, `seekable` L15-37) return False
  - Context manager support (`__enter__`, `__exit__` L48-57) for safe resource management
  - Iterator protocol (`__iter__`, `__next__` L42-46) returns single empty string

- `NULL_FILE` constant (L69): Pre-instantiated singleton instance for immediate use

**Dependencies**: 
- `typing` module for IO interface and type annotations
- `types.TracebackType` for context manager exception handling

**Usage Pattern**: Serves as a safe default or placeholder when file operations need to be suppressed without raising exceptions. Common in logging systems, test environments, or conditional output scenarios where output may need to be silently discarded.

**Key Invariant**: All operations are guaranteed to be safe no-ops that never raise exceptions, making it suitable for error-prone contexts where file operations might fail.
