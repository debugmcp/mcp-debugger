## Purpose
Rich library module for inspecting and rendering Python objects with customizable formatting, documentation extraction, and attribute filtering. Part of the Rich terminal UI library's inspection capabilities.

## Core Classes

### Inspect (L23-235)
Main renderable class that provides comprehensive object inspection with Rich formatting. Inherits from `JupyterMixin` for notebook compatibility.

**Key Methods:**
- `__init__(L39-64)`: Configures inspection parameters (help, methods, docs, private, dunder, sort, all, value)
- `_make_title(L66-74)`: Generates title text based on object type (class/callable/module vs instance)
- `__rich__(L76-82)`: Returns formatted Panel containing inspection results
- `_get_signature(L84-121)`: Extracts callable signatures with source file linking and proper prefixes (class/async def/def)
- `_render(L123-214)`: Core rendering logic that builds attribute table with filtering and sorting
- `_get_formatted_doc(L216-235)`: Processes docstrings with cleaning, paragraph extraction, and control code escaping

**Inspection Features:**
- Attribute filtering by visibility (private, dunder)
- Method signature extraction with source file links
- Docstring formatting (first paragraph vs full help)
- Pretty-printed values for non-callable objects
- Sorted attribute display with callable/non-callable grouping
- Error handling for inaccessible attributes

## Utility Functions

### _first_paragraph (L17-20)
Extracts first paragraph from docstring by splitting on double newlines.

### get_object_types_mro (L238-244)
Returns Method Resolution Order tuple for object's class or the object itself if it's a class. Handles edge cases with `__mro__` attribute checking.

### get_object_types_mro_as_strings (L247-257)
Converts MRO to fully qualified class names (module.qualname format) for string-based type checking.

### is_object_one_of_types (L260-270)
Type membership checker using fully qualified names, useful for cross-module type identification without direct imports.

## Dependencies
- Rich components: Console, Panel, Table, Text, Pretty, ReprHighlighter
- Python introspection: inspect module (cleandoc, getdoc, getfile, signature)
- Control code handling for safe terminal output

## Architecture Notes
- Uses Rich's renderable protocol (`__rich__` method)
- Implements safe attribute access with exception capture
- Provides flexible filtering system for different inspection levels
- Integrates with Rich's styling system for syntax highlighting
