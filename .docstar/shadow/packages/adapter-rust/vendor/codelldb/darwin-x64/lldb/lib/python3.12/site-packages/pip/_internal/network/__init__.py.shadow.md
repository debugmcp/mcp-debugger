**Purpose**: Python package initialization file for pip's internal network utilities module.

**Structure**: This is a minimal `__init__.py` file that serves as the entry point for the `pip._internal.network` package. Contains only a module-level docstring (L1-2) describing the package's purpose.

**Dependencies**: None explicitly imported in this file.

**Architecture**: Part of pip's internal architecture, specifically the network-related utilities subsystem. The actual network functionality would be implemented in other modules within this package directory.

**Key Elements**:
- Module docstring (L1-2): Documents that this package contains network-related utilities

**Patterns**: Standard Python package initialization pattern with descriptive docstring but no explicit imports or initialization code.

**Notes**: This is a gateway file - the actual network utilities would be defined in sibling modules within the same package directory. The minimal nature suggests this package follows a clean separation of concerns, with network functionality isolated from other pip internals.
