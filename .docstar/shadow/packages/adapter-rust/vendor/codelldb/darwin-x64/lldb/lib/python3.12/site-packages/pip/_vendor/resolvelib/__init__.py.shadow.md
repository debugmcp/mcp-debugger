## Purpose
Package initialization file for ResolveLib - a dependency resolution library. Defines public API surface and version information for the package.

## Key Components
- **__version__ (L14)**: Package version string "1.0.1"
- **__all__ (L1-12)**: Explicit public API declaration listing 11 exported symbols

## Public API Structure
The module exposes three categories of components:

**Abstract Interfaces (L17-18)**:
- `AbstractProvider`: Base class for dependency providers
- `AbstractResolver`: Base class for resolution implementations

**Reporting Infrastructure (L18)**:
- `BaseReporter`: Base class for resolution progress reporting

**Core Resolution Components (L19-26)**:
- `Resolver`: Main dependency resolution engine
- Exception hierarchy for resolution failures:
  - `ResolutionError`: Base exception class
  - `ResolutionImpossible`: Cannot satisfy constraints
  - `ResolutionTooDeep`: Resolution exceeded depth limits
  - `RequirementsConflicted`: Conflicting requirements detected
  - `InconsistentCandidate`: Invalid candidate state

## Module Dependencies
- `.providers`: Contains abstract provider interfaces
- `.reporters`: Contains reporting base classes  
- `.resolvers`: Contains main resolver implementation and exception types

## Architectural Pattern
Follows clean separation of concerns with abstract interfaces for extensibility and concrete implementations for core functionality. Uses explicit `__all__` declaration for controlled API exposure.
