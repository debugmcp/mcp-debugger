**Purpose**: IPython extension loader for Rich library integration. Enables Rich's pretty printing and enhanced traceback formatting when loaded as an IPython/Jupyter extension.

**Key Function**:
- `load_ipython_extension(ip: Any) (L4-10)`: Entry point function called by IPython's extension system. Installs Rich's pretty printer and traceback formatter. Uses lazy imports to avoid circular dependencies.

**Dependencies**:
- `pip._vendor.rich.pretty.install`: Activates Rich's enhanced pretty printing
- `pip._vendor.rich.traceback.install`: Enables Rich's styled traceback formatting

**Usage Pattern**: This follows IPython's standard extension protocol where `load_ipython_extension` is the conventional entry point. Users can load this via `%load_ext pip._vendor.rich._extension` in IPython/Jupyter.

**Implementation Notes**: 
- Imports are deferred inside the function to prevent circular import issues
- No configuration parameters exposed - uses default Rich settings
- Pragma no cover indicates this is likely tested through integration rather than unit tests
