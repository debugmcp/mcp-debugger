**Primary Purpose:** Initialization module for pip's importlib-based metadata adapter, providing access to package distribution and environment abstractions.

**Key Components:**
- `Distribution` (L1): Imported from `._dists`, represents individual package distributions with metadata access capabilities
- `Environment` (L2): Imported from `._envs`, represents the Python environment containing installed packages
- `NAME` (L6): Module identifier constant set to "importlib", likely used for adapter selection/identification
- `__all__` (L4): Public API export list defining the module's interface

**Architecture Role:**
This serves as the public interface for pip's importlib metadata adapter, one of several metadata backends pip can use. The importlib adapter leverages Python's built-in `importlib.metadata` for package introspection, contrasting with other adapters that might use pkg_resources or direct file parsing.

**Dependencies:**
- Local modules `._dists` and `._envs` containing the core implementation
- Implicitly depends on Python's importlib.metadata infrastructure

**Usage Pattern:**
Clients import `Distribution` and `Environment` from this module to interact with installed packages using the importlib metadata backend. The `NAME` constant allows pip's adapter selection mechanism to identify this specific implementation.
