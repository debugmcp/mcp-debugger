## Purpose
Command-line demo script for the platformdirs library, showcasing how to retrieve platform-specific directory paths for applications across different operating systems.

## Key Components

### Constants
- `PROPS` (L7-23): Tuple containing all available directory property names that can be retrieved from PlatformDirs objects, including user directories (data, config, cache, state, log, documents, downloads, pictures, videos, music, runtime) and site directories (data, config, cache, runtime).

### Functions
- `main()` (L26-51): Primary entry point that demonstrates four different PlatformDirs initialization patterns:
  1. With app name, author, and version (L34)
  2. With app name and author only (L39) 
  3. With app name only (L44)
  4. With app name and explicitly disabled app author (L49)

Each demonstration iterates through all properties in `PROPS` and prints the resolved directory paths.

## Dependencies
- `PlatformDirs`: Main class from pip._vendor.platformdirs for cross-platform directory resolution
- `__version__`: Version string from the same module

## Architecture
Simple demonstration script following the standard Python `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern (L54-55). Uses hardcoded example values ("MyApp", "MyCompany", "1.0") to show different initialization approaches.

## Usage Pattern
Designed to be run as a standalone module to show platform-specific directory paths that applications can use for storing data, configuration, cache files, etc. Output is formatted for human readability with section headers and consistent formatting.
