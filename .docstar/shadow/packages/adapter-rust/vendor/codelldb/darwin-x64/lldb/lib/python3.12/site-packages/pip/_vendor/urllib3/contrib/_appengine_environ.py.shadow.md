## Purpose
Environment detection utility for Google App Engine runtime environments, providing boolean checks to determine execution context within App Engine's various deployment modes.

## Core Functions

**`is_appengine()` (L8-9)**: Master detection function that returns `True` if running in any App Engine environment (local or production).

**`is_appengine_sandbox()` (L12-19)**: Identifies first-generation App Engine sandbox environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME="python27"`. Second-generation runtimes have relaxed sandbox restrictions.

**`is_local_appengine()` (L22-25)**: Detects local development server by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` environment variable and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Development/".

**`is_prod_appengine()` (L28-31)**: Identifies production App Engine environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Google App Engine/".

**`is_prod_appengine_mvms()` (L34-36)**: Deprecated function that always returns `False`. Originally for Managed VMs detection.

## Dependencies
- `os`: For environment variable access via `os.environ`

## Detection Strategy
All functions rely on environment variables set by App Engine runtime:
- `APPENGINE_RUNTIME`: Present in all App Engine environments
- `SERVER_SOFTWARE`: Contains runtime-specific prefixes for environment differentiation

## Usage Pattern
Designed for conditional logic in urllib3 to handle App Engine's network and HTTP limitations. Functions can be used independently or combined for granular environment detection.
