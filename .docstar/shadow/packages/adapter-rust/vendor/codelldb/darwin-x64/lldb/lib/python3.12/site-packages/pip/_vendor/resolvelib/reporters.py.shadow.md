**Purpose:** Defines the abstract reporter interface for tracking and reporting progress during dependency resolution in the resolvelib package.

**Core Class:**
- `BaseReporter` (L1-43): Abstract base class that provides hooks for monitoring resolution lifecycle events. Acts as a delegate pattern implementation allowing external observers to track resolution progress without coupling to the resolver's internal implementation.

**Lifecycle Hooks:**
- `starting()` (L4): Pre-resolution initialization hook
- `starting_round(index)` (L7): Called at beginning of each resolution round (zero-based indexing)
- `ending_round(index, state)` (L13): Called at end of each round except the final one
- `ending(state)` (L20): Final resolution completion hook

**Resolution Event Hooks:**
- `adding_requirement(requirement, parent)` (L23): Tracks new requirements being added to criteria, with parent candidate context or None for root requirements
- `resolving_conflicts(causes)` (L33): Monitors conflict resolution attempts with collision information
- `rejecting_candidate(criterion, candidate)` (L39): Reports candidate rejections during backtracking
- `pinning(candidate)` (L42): Tracks candidates being added to potential solutions

**Dependencies:** None - standalone abstract interface

**Architectural Pattern:** Observer/Visitor pattern for resolution monitoring. All methods are no-op stubs meant to be overridden by concrete implementations.

**Key Design Notes:**
- Zero-based round indexing throughout
- Clear distinction between round ending vs. resolution ending
- Parent-child relationship tracking for requirement dependencies
- Backtracking and conflict resolution visibility
