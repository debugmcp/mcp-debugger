## Purpose
Defines abstract base classes for the resolvelib dependency resolution framework. This file establishes the provider-resolver pattern where providers supply dependency information and resolvers orchestrate the resolution process.

## Key Classes

### AbstractProvider (L1-109)
Core interface for dependency resolution providers. Implements the strategy pattern to abstract dependency data sources and resolution policies.

**Required Methods:**
- `identify(requirement_or_candidate)` (L4-10): Maps requirements/candidates to unique identifiers for deduplication and comparison
- `get_preference(identifier, resolutions, candidates, information, backtrack_causes)` (L12-61): Returns sort keys for resolution order prioritization - lower values = higher priority
- `find_matches(identifier, requirements, incompatibilities)` (L63-90): Discovers candidate packages satisfying constraints, excluding incompatibilities
- `is_satisfied_by(requirement, candidate)` (L92-101): Validates if a candidate fulfills a requirement's constraints
- `get_dependencies(candidate)` (L103-109): Extracts dependency requirements from a candidate package

**Key Concepts:**
- Requirement information tuples contain `requirement` and `parent` fields (L38-43)
- Preference calculation considers pinning status, constraint strictness, solution space size, and conflict density (L45-54)
- Candidates should be returned in preference order (L81-82)

### AbstractResolver (L112-133) 
Base resolver orchestrating the resolution algorithm using provider services.

**Attributes:**
- `base_exception` (L115): Exception type for resolution failures
- `provider` (L118): AbstractProvider implementation
- `reporter` (L119): Progress/event reporting interface

**Methods:**
- `__init__(provider, reporter)` (L117-119): Initializes resolver with provider and reporter
- `resolve(requirements, **kwargs)` (L121-133): Main resolution entry point returning result with `mapping` attribute containing identifier→candidate mappings

## Architecture
Implements clean separation of concerns: providers handle domain-specific dependency logic while resolvers manage the generic resolution algorithm. This enables pluggable dependency sources (PyPI, conda, etc.) with consistent resolution behavior.
