**Primary Purpose**: Container for managing pip package requirements during dependency resolution and installation planning. Maintains separation between named requirements (with package names) and unnamed requirements (direct URLs, local paths).

**Core Class**: 
- `RequirementSet` (L12-82): Central requirement management container with dual storage model

**Key Attributes**:
- `requirements` (L16): OrderedDict mapping canonicalized package names to InstallRequirement objects
- `unnamed_requirements` (L19): List for requirements without package names (URLs, local paths)
- `check_supported_wheels` (L17): Boolean flag for wheel compatibility validation

**Key Methods**:
- `add_named_requirement()` (L45-49): Adds requirement with package name using canonicalized key
- `add_unnamed_requirement()` (L41-43): Adds requirement without name to separate list
- `has_requirement()` (L51-57): Checks existence of non-constraint requirement by name
- `get_requirement()` (L59-65): Retrieves requirement by name, raises KeyError if not found
- `all_requirements` property (L67-69): Combines both named and unnamed requirements
- `requirements_to_install` property (L72-82): Filters requirements needing installation (excludes constraints and satisfied packages)

**Key Dependencies**:
- `pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement`: Core requirement representation
- `pip._vendor.packaging.utils.canonicalize_name`: Package name normalization

**Architectural Patterns**:
- Dual storage strategy separating named vs unnamed requirements
- Canonicalized names as dictionary keys for consistent lookups
- Property-based filtered views of requirement collections
- Assertion-based precondition validation

**Critical Constraints**:
- Named requirements must have non-empty names (L46 assertion)
- Unnamed requirements must have empty names (L42 assertion)
- Package name canonicalization ensures case-insensitive, normalized lookups
- Constraint requirements excluded from installation filtering
