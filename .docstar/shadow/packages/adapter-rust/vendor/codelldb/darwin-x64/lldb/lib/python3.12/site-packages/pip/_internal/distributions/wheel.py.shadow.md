This module defines the `WheelDistribution` class, a concrete implementation of `AbstractDistribution` specifically for handling wheel packages in pip's distribution management system.

## Primary Purpose
Handles wheel distributions that require no build preparation since they can be directly unpacked and installed.

## Key Components

### WheelDistribution Class (L16-42)
Concrete distribution implementation for wheel packages that inherits from `AbstractDistribution`.

**Key Methods:**
- `build_tracker_id` property (L23-24): Returns `None` since wheels don't require build tracking
- `get_metadata_distribution()` (L26-34): Loads wheel metadata into memory by creating a `FilesystemWheel` from the local file path and returning a `BaseDistribution` via `get_wheel_distribution()`
- `prepare_distribution_metadata()` (L36-42): No-op implementation since wheels require no preparation

## Dependencies
- `AbstractDistribution` from `pip._internal.distributions.base` - base class
- `FilesystemWheel`, `BaseDistribution`, `get_wheel_distribution` from `pip._internal.metadata` - metadata handling
- `canonicalize_name` from `pip._vendor.packaging.utils` - name normalization
- `PackageFinder` type hint for metadata preparation method

## Architectural Patterns
- Template Method pattern: Implements abstract methods from `AbstractDistribution`
- Assertion-based validation: Uses assertions to verify required state (`req.local_file_path` and `req.name` must exist)
- Lazy metadata loading: Only loads wheel metadata when explicitly requested

## Key Invariants
- Wheel distributions must have a local file path set during preparation/download
- Wheel distributions are never unnamed
- No build isolation or dependency checking needed for wheels
