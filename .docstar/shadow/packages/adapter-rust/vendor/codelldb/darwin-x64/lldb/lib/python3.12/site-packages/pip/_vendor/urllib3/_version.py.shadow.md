## Purpose
Version declaration module for urllib3 library. Contains a single version string constant used for package identification and dependency management.

## Key Elements
- `__version__` (L2): String constant defining urllib3 version as "1.26.18"

## Dependencies
None - standalone module with no imports.

## Architecture Notes
- Protected by CODEOWNERS (L1) indicating restricted modification access
- Follows standard Python versioning convention using `__version__` attribute
- Uses semantic versioning format (major.minor.patch)
- Located within pip's vendored urllib3 package, suggesting this is a bundled/frozen version

## Usage Context
This module is typically imported by other modules to access version information for:
- Package metadata registration
- Version compatibility checks
- Runtime version reporting
- Distribution building processes
