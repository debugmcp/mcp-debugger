## Primary Purpose
Base resolver interface for pip's dependency resolution system. Defines the contract that concrete resolvers must implement to handle package dependency resolution and installation ordering.

## Key Components

**InstallRequirementProvider (L6-8)**: Type alias defining a callable that takes a package name string and optional InstallRequirement, returning an InstallRequirement. Used for requirement provisioning during resolution.

**BaseResolver (L11-20)**: Abstract base class defining the resolver interface with two required methods:
- `resolve()` (L12-15): Core resolution method taking root requirements and wheel support flag, returning a RequirementSet
- `get_installation_order()` (L17-20): Determines installation sequence from a resolved RequirementSet, returning ordered InstallRequirement list

## Dependencies
- `pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement`: Individual package requirement representation
- `pip._internal.req.req_set.RequirementSet`: Collection of resolved requirements

## Architectural Pattern
Classic abstract base class pattern using NotImplementedError to enforce interface compliance. Concrete resolver implementations must inherit from BaseResolver and provide both resolution logic and installation ordering algorithms.

## Key Constraints
- Both abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses
- Resolution process separates dependency solving from installation ordering
- Supports optional wheel compatibility checking during resolution
