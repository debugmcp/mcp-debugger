## Purpose
Package initialization file for pip's command line interface (CLI) subsystem. This file serves as a namespace marker for the `pip._internal.cli` package containing all CLI-related functionality.

## Architecture
- **Minimal Init Pattern**: Deliberately avoids importing submodules (L4) to prevent circular imports and reduce initialization overhead
- **Package Marker**: Establishes the CLI package boundary within pip's internal architecture
- **Lazy Loading**: Submodules are loaded on-demand rather than at package import time

## Key Design Decisions
- **No Eager Imports**: Comment on L4 explicitly states submodules are not imported, suggesting this is an intentional design choice to avoid import-time side effects
- **Documentation Only**: Contains only package-level documentation (L1-2) without any executable code

## Dependencies
- None (intentionally minimal)

## Usage Context
This file is part of pip's internal CLI infrastructure, likely containing submodules for argument parsing, command dispatch, and user interaction. The lazy loading approach suggests the CLI subsystem has multiple components that should only be loaded when actually needed.
