## Purpose
Abstract base class defining the reporter interface for the ResolveLib dependency resolution library. Provides hooks for monitoring resolution progress, conflict detection, and candidate selection throughout the resolution process.

## Key Components

### BaseReporter (L1-43)
Abstract reporter class that defines callback methods for different phases of dependency resolution:

**Lifecycle Management:**
- `starting()` (L4-5): Called before resolution begins
- `starting_round(index)` (L7-11): Called at start of each resolution round (zero-based indexing)  
- `ending_round(index, state)` (L13-18): Called at end of each round (NOT called for final round)
- `ending(state)` (L20-21): Called when resolution completes successfully

**Resolution Events:**
- `adding_requirement(requirement, parent)` (L23-31): Called when new requirement added to criteria
  - `requirement`: New requirement to filter candidates
  - `parent`: Candidate requiring this dependency (None for root requirements)
- `resolving_conflicts(causes)` (L33-37): Called when conflict resolution begins
  - `causes`: Information about collision causing backtracking
- `rejecting_candidate(criterion, candidate)` (L39-40): Called during backtracking when candidate rejected
- `pinning(candidate)` (L42-43): Called when candidate added to potential solution

## Architecture Notes
- All methods are no-op stubs - implementing classes must override desired callbacks
- Follows observer pattern for non-intrusive progress monitoring
- Designed for integration with pip's dependency resolver
- State objects passed to lifecycle methods contain resolution state snapshots
