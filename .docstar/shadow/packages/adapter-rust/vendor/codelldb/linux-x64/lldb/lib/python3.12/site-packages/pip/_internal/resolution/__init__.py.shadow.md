## Purpose
Empty Python package initialization file for the `pip._internal.resolution` module. This file serves as a package marker to make the `resolution` directory recognizable as a Python package.

## Structure
- **File Type**: Package initialization (`__init__.py`)
- **Content**: Empty file with no code, classes, or functions
- **Location**: Part of pip's internal resolution subsystem

## Functionality
This file enables Python to treat the `resolution` directory as a package, allowing imports of submodules within the resolution namespace. The resolution package likely contains dependency resolution logic for pip's package installation process.

## Dependencies
- None (empty file)

## Architectural Notes
- Standard Python package pattern
- Part of pip's internal API structure
- Enables modular organization of resolution-related functionality
