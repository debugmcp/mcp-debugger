## Purpose
Diagnostic utility for the Rich library providing environment and console capability reporting. Part of pip's vendored Rich package, used for debugging terminal rendering issues.

## Key Components

### Main Function
- **`report()` (L10-34)**: Primary diagnostic function that outputs comprehensive environment information including console capabilities, environment variables, and platform details. Marked with pragma no cover indicating it's excluded from test coverage.

### Environment Analysis
- **Environment Variables Collection (L17-31)**: Captures terminal-related environment variables including:
  - Terminal identification: `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM`
  - Color support: `CLICOLOR`, `NO_COLOR`  
  - Dimensions: `COLUMNS`, `LINES`, `JUPYTER_COLUMNS`, `JUPYTER_LINES`
  - IDE integration: `VSCODE_VERBOSE_LOGGING`, `JPY_PARENT_PID`

### Output Format
- Uses Rich's `Panel.fit()` and `Pretty()` for formatted environment variable display
- Includes platform system information via `platform.system()`
- Leverages `inspect()` function for console and Windows feature introspection

## Dependencies
- **Rich Components**: Console, Panel, Pretty, inspect utilities
- **System Modules**: os, platform for environment/system information
- **Windows Integration**: `get_windows_console_features()` for platform-specific capabilities

## Execution Context
- **CLI Entry Point (L36-37)**: Direct execution calls `report()` function
- **Coverage Exclusion**: Both main functions excluded from test coverage (pragma no cover)

## Architectural Role
Serves as a standalone diagnostic tool within pip's Rich integration, providing developers with comprehensive terminal capability information for troubleshooting rendering issues across different platforms and terminal emulators.
