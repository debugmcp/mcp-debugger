## Purpose
Package initialization file for `tomli` - a TOML parser library. Serves as the public API entry point by exposing core parsing functionality and error handling.

## Key Components
- **Public API exports (L5)**: Exposes `loads`, `load`, and `TOMLDecodeError` as the complete public interface
- **Version declaration (L6)**: Hardcoded version "2.0.1" with automation comment indicating version bumping is managed externally
- **Core imports (L8)**: Imports all functionality from internal `_parser` module
- **Exception module patching (L11)**: Modifies `TOMLDecodeError.__module__` to make the exception appear as if it originates from this package rather than the internal `_parser` module

## Architecture Pattern
Follows standard Python package structure where `__init__.py` acts as a facade, hiding internal module organization while providing a clean public API. The exception module patching is a common pattern for maintaining clean stack traces and API consistency.

## Dependencies
- Internal dependency on `._parser` module containing actual implementation
- External tooling dependency on `bump2version` utility for version management

## Critical Constraints
- Version string must not be manually edited (managed by external tooling)
- Public API is limited to exactly three symbols as defined in `__all__`
