## Purpose
Environment detection utility for Google App Engine runtime identification. Provides boolean checks to determine if code is running in various App Engine environments including local development, production, and legacy sandbox modes.

## Key Functions

### `is_appengine()` (L8-9)
Primary detection function that returns `True` if running in any App Engine environment (local or production). Combines results from local and production checks.

### `is_appengine_sandbox()` (L12-19)
Detects first-generation App Engine sandbox (Python 2.7 runtime). Uses environment variable `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` to identify restrictive sandbox environment. Second-generation runtimes have relaxed restrictions.

### `is_local_appengine()` (L22-25)
Identifies local development environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` environment variable and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Development/".

### `is_prod_appengine()` (L28-31)
Detects production App Engine environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` environment variable and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Google App Engine/".

### `is_prod_appengine_mvms()` (L34-36)
Deprecated function that always returns `False`. Legacy compatibility stub.

## Dependencies
- `os` module for environment variable access

## Key Environment Variables
- `APPENGINE_RUNTIME`: Indicates App Engine runtime (e.g., "python27")
- `SERVER_SOFTWARE`: Identifies server type ("Development/" for local, "Google App Engine/" for production)

## Architecture Notes
Simple boolean detection pattern using environment variables as runtime indicators. Functions are designed for conditional execution paths in urllib3 when running on App Engine infrastructure.
