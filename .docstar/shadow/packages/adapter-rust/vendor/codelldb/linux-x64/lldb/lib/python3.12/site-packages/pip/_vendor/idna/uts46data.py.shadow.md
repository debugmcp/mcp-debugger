This file contains automatically generated Unicode normalization data for IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) conformance, specifically implementing the UTS46 (Unicode Technical Standard #46) mapping table.

## Primary Purpose
Provides Unicode character mapping data for domain name normalization according to UTS46 standard. The data maps Unicode code points to their normalized forms or processing instructions.

## Key Components

### Module-level Variables
- `__version__` (L10): Version string "15.1.0" indicating the Unicode version
- `uts46data` (L8515-8598): Main data structure - a tuple containing all mapping entries

### Segment Functions
- `_seg_0()` through `_seg_81()` (L11-8513): 82 functions that return lists of Unicode mapping tuples
- Each function returns approximately 100-200 mapping entries to avoid Python's limitations on large data structures

### Data Structure Format
Each mapping entry is a tuple containing:
- `(codepoint, action)` for simple mappings
- `(codepoint, action, replacement)` for character substitutions

Where:
- `codepoint`: Unicode code point as hexadecimal integer
- `action`: Single character indicating processing rule:
  - `'V'`: Valid - character is allowed as-is
  - `'M'`: Mapped - character should be replaced with the replacement string
  - `'X'`: Disallowed - character is not permitted
  - `'D'`: Deviation - context-dependent processing
  - `'I'`: Ignored - character should be removed
  - `'3'`: Disallowed except in specific contexts
- `replacement`: Target character(s) for mapped characters

### Data Coverage
- Covers the full Unicode range from U+0000 to U+E01EF
- Includes mappings for:
  - ASCII characters with case folding (L78-103: A-Z → a-z)
  - Latin extended characters with diacritical mark removal
  - Mathematical symbols and formatted text normalization
  - CJK ideographs and compatibility characters
  - Arabic script normalization
  - Various other Unicode blocks

## Notable Patterns
- Extensive case folding: uppercase letters mapped to lowercase equivalents
- Diacritical mark normalization: accented characters mapped to base forms
- Mathematical font variants normalized to standard ASCII/Unicode
- Compatibility character unification (e.g., full-width characters to half-width)
- Script-specific normalization rules for non-Latin writing systems

## Usage Context
This data is consumed by IDNA processing libraries to normalize domain names before DNS resolution, ensuring consistent representation across different Unicode input forms.
