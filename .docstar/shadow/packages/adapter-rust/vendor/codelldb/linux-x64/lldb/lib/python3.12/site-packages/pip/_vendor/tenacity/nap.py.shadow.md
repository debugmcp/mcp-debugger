## Primary Purpose
Sleep strategy implementations for the tenacity retry library, providing flexible delay mechanisms during retry operations.

## Key Components

### Functions
- **`sleep(seconds: float)`** (L25-31): Default blocking sleep strategy using `time.sleep()`. Designed to be mockable for unit testing. Takes a float duration and blocks execution for that period.

### Classes
- **`sleep_using_event`** (L34-43): Event-based sleep strategy that can be interrupted early. 
  - `__init__(event: threading.Event)` (L37-38): Stores threading event for coordination
  - `__call__(timeout: Optional[float])` (L40-43): Waits on the event with optional timeout, may return early if event is set

## Dependencies
- **Standard library**: `time` for basic sleep functionality, `typing` for type hints
- **Conditional import**: `threading` (TYPE_CHECKING only) for event-based strategy

## Architectural Patterns
- **Strategy pattern**: Multiple interchangeable sleep implementations
- **Callable objects**: `sleep_using_event` implements `__call__` to match function signature of `sleep`
- **Early termination**: Event-based strategy allows interrupting delays, useful for graceful shutdowns

## Key Design Decisions
- Function and class both serve as sleep strategies with compatible signatures
- Event-based approach enables cooperative cancellation of retry delays
- Type hints support both required and optional timeout parameters
- Minimal dependencies for core functionality
