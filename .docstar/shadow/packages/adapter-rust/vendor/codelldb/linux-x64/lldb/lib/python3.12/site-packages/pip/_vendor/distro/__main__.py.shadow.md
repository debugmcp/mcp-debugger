## Purpose
Entry point module for the pip-vendored distro package, enabling command-line execution of the distro library functionality.

## Structure
- **Import statement (L1)**: Imports the `main` function from the sibling `distro` module
- **Main execution block (L3-4)**: Standard Python idiom that executes `main()` when the module is run directly as a script

## Key Components
- **main() function call (L4)**: Delegates all CLI functionality to the main distro module's entry point

## Dependencies
- Depends on `.distro` module which must provide a `main()` function
- Part of pip's vendored package structure under `pip._vendor.distro`

## Architectural Role
This is a minimal launcher module following Python's standard pattern for making packages executable via `python -m package_name`. The actual CLI logic resides in the main distro module, keeping this file focused solely on the entry point responsibility.

## Usage Context
Enables execution of distro functionality through commands like:
- `python -m pip._vendor.distro`
- Direct execution if the file is run as a script

The module serves as a thin wrapper that maintains the separation between package structure and CLI implementation.
