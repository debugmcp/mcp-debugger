## Rich Library Demo Module

This module serves as the main demonstration and testing entry point for the Rich terminal formatting library, showcasing its various rendering capabilities and features.

### Core Components

**ColorBox (L18-36)**: Custom renderable that generates a colorful gradient display using HSL color space. Implements Rich's rendering protocol with `__rich_console__()` and `__rich_measure__()` methods. Creates a 5-row gradient pattern using Unicode block characters with calculated foreground and background colors.

**make_test_card() (L39-206)**: Primary demonstration function that constructs a comprehensive Table showcasing Rich's features including:
- Color support (4-bit, 8-bit, truecolor) with ColorBox integration
- Text styling (bold, dim, italic, underline, strikethrough, reverse, blink)
- Text justification and word wrapping with lorem ipsum examples
- Asian language support with Chinese, Japanese, Korean text
- BBCode-like markup with emoji support
- Table rendering with movie data examples
- Syntax highlighting using Python code sample (L156-167)
- Pretty printing of Python data structures
- Markdown rendering capabilities

**comparison() (L90-95)**: Helper function creating side-by-side table layouts for comparing different rendering outputs.

### Main Execution Block (L209-273)

Performance testing section that:
- Measures rendering performance with cold vs warm cache (L217-226)
- Times test card rendering twice to demonstrate caching effects
- Displays sponsor information and introductory message in a styled panel
- Uses multiple Console instances for different output destinations

### Dependencies

Heavy reliance on Rich components:
- Console, Table, Text, Syntax, Pretty, Markdown for content rendering
- Color, Style, Segment for styling and low-level rendering
- Panel for final message presentation
- Various box styles and measurement utilities

### Architecture Pattern

Follows Rich's renderable protocol pattern where objects implement `__rich_console__()` for custom rendering behavior. Demonstrates composition of complex layouts using nested tables and groups.

### Key Constants

- Lorem ipsum text (L71) for text justification demos
- Python code sample (L156-167) for syntax highlighting
- Movie data (L129-152) for table examples
- Markdown sample (L188-197) for markup demonstration
