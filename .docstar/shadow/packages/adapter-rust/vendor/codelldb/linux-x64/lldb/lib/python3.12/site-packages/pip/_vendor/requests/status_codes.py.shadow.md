## Purpose
HTTP status code mapping module that provides a convenient interface for accessing HTTP status codes by human-readable names. Creates a bidirectional mapping between numeric HTTP status codes and descriptive aliases.

## Key Components

### Core Data Structure
- **_codes (L23-104)**: Dictionary mapping HTTP status codes to tuples of string aliases. Covers informational (1xx), success (2xx), redirection (3xx), client error (4xx), and server error (5xx) status codes. Includes creative aliases like "\\o/" for 200 OK and "teapot" for 418.

### Public Interface
- **codes (L106)**: LookupDict instance that serves as the primary interface. Supports both attribute access (`codes.ok`) and dictionary access (`codes['ok']`).

### Initialization
- **_init() (L109-125)**: Populates the codes object with mappings. Creates both lowercase and uppercase versions of aliases (except those starting with "\\" or "/"). Also dynamically generates module documentation listing all available codes and their aliases.

## Dependencies
- **LookupDict**: Imported from `.structures` module (L21) - provides case-insensitive dictionary-like access with attribute notation support.

## Key Features
- **Multiple aliases per code**: Many status codes have several descriptive names (e.g., 200 maps to "ok", "okay", "all_ok", "all_okay", "all_good", "\\o/", "✓")
- **Case insensitive**: Both upper and lowercase versions of most aliases are available
- **Creative aliases**: Includes emoji and ASCII art representations for some common codes
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes both standard and non-standard HTTP status codes

## Architectural Decisions
- Uses tuple storage for aliases to ensure immutability
- Excludes special character aliases from automatic uppercase generation
- Dynamically builds module documentation from the data structure
- Separates data definition from initialization for clarity

## Usage Pattern
Designed for use as `requests.codes.status_name` or `requests.codes['status_name']` to get numeric HTTP status codes, providing a more readable alternative to hardcoded numeric literals in HTTP client code.
