## Purpose
This file defines the abstract protocol interface for Rich renderable objects in the Rich text and formatting library. It provides a way to check if arbitrary objects support Rich's rendering protocol without requiring explicit inheritance.

## Key Classes

### RichRenderable (L4-18)
Abstract base class that defines the Rich renderable protocol. Uses duck typing through `__subclasshook__` to identify objects that implement either `__rich_console__` or `__rich__` methods, allowing them to be rendered by Rich's console system.

Key method:
- `__subclasshook__(cls, other: type) -> bool` (L16-18): Implements protocol detection by checking for presence of `__rich_console__` or `__rich__` attributes on target classes

## Dependencies
- `abc.ABC`: Standard library abstract base class functionality
- `pip._vendor.rich.text.Text`: Used in test code only (L22)

## Architectural Pattern
Implements a **protocol-based interface** using Python's `__subclasshook__` mechanism. This allows any object with appropriate methods to be automatically recognized as renderable without explicit inheritance, following Python's duck typing philosophy.

## Usage Pattern
Primary use case is isinstance checks to determine if objects can be rendered:
```python
if isinstance(my_object, RichRenderable):
    console.print(my_object)
```

## Test Code (L21-33)
Contains demonstration code showing protocol detection for Text objects (which implement the protocol) vs plain objects (which don't).
