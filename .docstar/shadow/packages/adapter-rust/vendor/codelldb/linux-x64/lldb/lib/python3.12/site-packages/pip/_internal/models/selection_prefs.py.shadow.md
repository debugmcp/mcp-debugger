## SelectionPreferences Model

This file defines a configuration object that controls package candidate selection behavior during pip installation and downloading operations.

### Primary Purpose
Encapsulates preferences for filtering and prioritizing package candidates, including handling of yanked packages, pre-releases, format preferences, and Python version compatibility checks.

### Key Components

**SelectionPreferences Class (L8-53)**
- Immutable-style configuration object using `__slots__` for memory efficiency
- Controls five key aspects of package selection behavior:
  - `allow_yanked` (L28): Whether yanked packages (PEP 592) can be installed
  - `allow_all_prereleases` (L29): Whether to consider pre-release versions
  - `format_control` (L30): Controls source vs binary package selection via FormatControl
  - `prefer_binary` (L31): Prioritizes older binary distributions over newer source
  - `ignore_requires_python` (L32): Bypasses Python version compatibility checks

**Constructor Design Pattern (L26-53)**
- Deliberately omits default for `allow_yanked` parameter to force explicit decision-making
- Normalizes `ignore_requires_python` from None to False for consistent behavior
- Extensive docstring documents each parameter's purpose and PEP references

### Dependencies
- `FormatControl` from `pip._internal.models.format_control` (L3) - controls package format selection
- `Optional` from typing for nullable parameters (L1)

### Architectural Notes
- Uses `__slots__` optimization pattern for memory efficiency in high-volume operations
- Designed as value object - no methods beyond initialization
- Future migration to dataclass blocked by Python 3.10 requirement (noted in TODO)
- API design enforces explicit yanked package handling decisions in calling code
