## Purpose
Custom logging utilities for pip's internal verbose output functionality. Extends Python's standard logging with a custom VERBOSE level (15) positioned between DEBUG and INFO.

## Key Components

**VERBOSE constant (L13)**: Custom log level set to 15, positioned between standard DEBUG (10) and INFO (20) levels.

**VerboseLogger class (L16-23)**: Extends `logging.Logger` to add verbose logging capability.
- `verbose()` method (L22-23): Logs messages at VERBOSE level, accepting standard logging arguments

**getLogger() function (L26-28)**: Wrapper around `logging.getLogger()` that returns typed VerboseLogger instances using `cast()` for type safety.

**init_logging() function (L31-37)**: Initialization function that must be called before any logging usage.
- Sets VerboseLogger as the default logger class via `logging.setLoggerClass()`
- Registers "VERBOSE" name for the custom level via `logging.addLevelName()`

## Dependencies
- Standard `logging` module
- `typing.Any` and `typing.cast` for type annotations

## Critical Constraints
- `init_logging()` must be called before any other modules invoke `logging.getLogger()` (documented requirement)
- Designed to be called from `pip._internal.__init__` during pip initialization

## Architecture Pattern
Follows Python logging best practices by:
1. Extending the base Logger class rather than monkey-patching
2. Properly registering custom log levels with the logging system
3. Providing type-safe wrapper functions for logger instantiation
4. Centralizing initialization to avoid race conditions
