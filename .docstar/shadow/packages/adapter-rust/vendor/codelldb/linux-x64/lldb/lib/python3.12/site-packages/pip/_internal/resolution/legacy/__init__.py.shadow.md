**Primary Purpose:** Empty Python module file serving as package initialization marker for pip's legacy dependency resolution system.

**Architecture:** This is an `__init__.py` file that makes the `pip._internal.resolution.legacy` directory a Python package. The file contains no code, indicating it serves purely as a package marker.

**Module Structure:** 
- No classes, functions, or variables defined
- No imports or dependencies
- No executable code

**Context:** Located within pip's internal resolution system, specifically in the legacy resolver implementation. This suggests pip maintains both legacy and modern resolution algorithms, with this file being part of the older implementation.

**Usage Pattern:** Standard Python packaging convention where empty `__init__.py` files enable directory imports without executing initialization code. Other modules in this package would contain the actual legacy resolution logic.

**Dependencies:** None - completely self-contained empty module.

**Architectural Significance:** Part of pip's modular resolver architecture, allowing the package manager to maintain backward compatibility through separate legacy resolution code paths.
