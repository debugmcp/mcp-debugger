## Purpose
Compatibility module that provides cross-Python version access to abstract base classes `Mapping` and `Sequence`. Handles the transition from Python 2/3.2 where these classes were in `collections` to Python 3.3+ where they moved to `collections.abc`.

## Key Components
- **Public interface (L1)**: Exports `Mapping` and `Sequence` abstract base classes
- **Compatibility import logic (L3-6)**: Primary import attempts `collections.abc` (modern Python), falls back to `collections` (legacy Python) on ImportError

## Dependencies
- `collections.abc` (Python 3.3+) - preferred source for abstract base classes
- `collections` (Python 2.7/3.2) - fallback source for abstract base classes

## Architectural Pattern
Uses try/except import pattern for backwards compatibility, ensuring the same interface regardless of Python version. This is a common shim pattern in compatibility layers.
