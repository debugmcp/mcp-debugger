**Primary Purpose**: Package initialization module for pip's importlib-based metadata adapter, providing a clean interface to distribution and environment metadata handling components.

**Module Structure**:
- **Distribution** (L1): Core class imported from `._dists` module, handles individual package distribution metadata
- **Environment** (L2): Environment class imported from `._envs` module, manages package environment state and operations
- **NAME** (L6): String constant "importlib" identifying this metadata adapter implementation
- **__all__** (L4): Public API exports controlling what gets imported with `from package import *`

**Architecture Role**: This is a metadata adapter implementation within pip's pluggable metadata system. The importlib adapter uses Python's built-in importlib.metadata functionality (introduced in Python 3.8) as the backend for discovering and inspecting installed packages, as opposed to other potential adapters that might use pkg_resources or direct filesystem inspection.

**Key Dependencies**: 
- Internal modules `._dists` and `._envs` containing the core implementation classes
- Implicitly depends on Python's importlib.metadata standard library module

**Usage Pattern**: This module follows the adapter pattern where different metadata backends can be swapped by changing the adapter module while maintaining the same Distribution and Environment interface contracts.
