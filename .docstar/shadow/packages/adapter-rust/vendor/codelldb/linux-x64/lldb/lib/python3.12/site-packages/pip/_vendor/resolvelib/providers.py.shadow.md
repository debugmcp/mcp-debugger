## Abstract Provider and Resolver Interface for Dependency Resolution

**Primary Purpose**: Defines abstract base classes that establish the contract for dependency resolution systems, specifically for package managers and similar tools that need to resolve complex dependency graphs.

### Key Classes

#### AbstractProvider (L1-109)
Core delegate interface that must be implemented to provide resolution logic to a resolver. Contains 5 critical abstract methods:

- **identify(requirement_or_candidate)** (L4-10): Maps requirements/candidates to unique identifiers for deduplication and merging
- **get_preference(identifier, resolutions, candidates, information, backtrack_causes)** (L12-61): Returns sort key for resolution ordering - lower values = higher priority. Takes current resolution state and backtrack history into account
- **find_matches(identifier, requirements, incompatibilities)** (L63-90): Core candidate discovery method that returns viable candidates satisfying constraints, ordered by preference. Handles VCS, local, archive, and named requirements differently
- **is_satisfied_by(requirement, candidate)** (L92-101): Boolean validator checking if specific candidate satisfies given requirement
- **get_dependencies(candidate)** (L103-109): Extracts dependency requirements from resolved candidates

#### AbstractResolver (L112-133)
Orchestrates the actual resolution process using a provider and reporter:

- **Constructor** (L117-119): Takes provider (resolution logic) and reporter (progress tracking)  
- **resolve(requirements, **kwargs)** (L121-133): Main entry point that processes constraint collection and returns resolution state with `mapping` attribute containing identifier→candidate pairs

### Architectural Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Provider abstracts resolution algorithms, resolver orchestrates
- **Template Method**: Resolver defines workflow, provider implements specifics
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean split between resolution logic (provider) and process management (resolver)

### Critical Design Elements

- Resolution preference system allows sophisticated ordering strategies based on conflicts, constraint strictness, and possibility space
- Support for multiple requirement types (VCS, local, archive, named) with type-specific handling
- Backtracking support through `backtrack_causes` parameter enables efficient conflict resolution
- Requirement information tuples carry both requirement and parent context for dependency tree reconstruction

### Dependencies
Part of resolvelib package within pip's vendored dependencies - interfaces with package resolution infrastructure.
