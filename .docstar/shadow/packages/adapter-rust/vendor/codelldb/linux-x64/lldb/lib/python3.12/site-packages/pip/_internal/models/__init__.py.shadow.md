**Purpose**: Package initialization file for pip's internal models module that defines data structures representing various entities within the pip package manager ecosystem.

**Structure**: This is a minimal package __init__.py file (L1-2) that serves as the entry point for the models package. The file only contains a docstring describing the package's purpose.

**Key Elements**:
- Package docstring (L1-2): Describes the module as containing model classes for entities

**Dependencies**: None declared in this file

**Architecture**: This follows standard Python package structure where __init__.py files serve as package markers and can expose public APIs from submodules. The models package likely contains separate modules with actual model implementations for different pip entities (packages, distributions, requirements, etc.).

**Expected Usage**: Other pip modules would import specific model classes from submodules within this package (e.g., `from pip._internal.models.candidate import Candidate`).

**Note**: This is a minimal initialization file - the actual model implementations are in separate modules within this package.
