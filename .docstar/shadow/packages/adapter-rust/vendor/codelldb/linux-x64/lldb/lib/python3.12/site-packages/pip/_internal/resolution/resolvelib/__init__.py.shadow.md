## Primary Purpose
This is an empty package initialization file for pip's resolvelib-based dependency resolution system. It serves as a Python package marker to make the `pip._internal.resolution.resolvelib` directory importable as a module.

## Key Components
- **Package Marker**: Empty `__init__.py` file that designates the directory as a Python package
- **Module Path**: Part of pip's internal resolution system using the resolvelib library for dependency resolution

## Dependencies and Relationships
- Located within pip's internal resolution architecture (`pip._internal.resolution`)
- Part of the resolvelib integration subsystem for handling dependency resolution
- Enables importing of sibling modules within the resolvelib resolution package

## Architectural Context
This file follows Python's standard package structure convention. The resolvelib package likely contains the actual implementation modules for pip's dependency resolution logic using the external resolvelib library. The empty initialization allows for clean module imports and potential future package-level initialization if needed.

## Implementation Notes
- No explicit imports, classes, or functions defined
- Relies on Python's implicit package discovery mechanism
- Maintains clean separation between different resolution backends within pip's architecture
