## Purpose
Debug utility providing timing context manager for measuring and printing execution duration of code blocks.

## Key Components

### `timer` function (L12-19)
Context manager that measures and prints elapsed execution time.

**Parameters:**
- `subject: str = "time"` - Label for the timing measurement output

**Behavior:**
- Records start time using `time.time()` (L15)
- Yields control to wrapped code block (L16)
- Calculates elapsed time on exit (L17)
- Converts to milliseconds and prints with 1 decimal precision (L18-19)

**Usage Pattern:**
```python
with timer("database query"):
    # code to measure
    pass
# Prints: "database query elapsed 123.4ms"
```

## Dependencies
- `time.time()` for high-resolution timing (L6)
- `contextlib` for context manager decorator (L8)
- `typing.Generator` for type hints (L9)

## Architecture Notes
- Pure utility function with no side effects beyond console output
- Designed specifically for debugging scenarios (not production monitoring)
- Uses generator-based context manager pattern via `@contextlib.contextmanager`
- Thread-safe for individual measurements (each context gets its own timing variables)
