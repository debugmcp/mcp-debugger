## Primary Purpose
Package initialization module for the certifi library, a vendored dependency within pip. Provides a simple public API for accessing SSL certificate bundle functionality.

## Key Components
- **Public API exports (L1, L3)**: Exposes `contents` and `where` functions from the core module
- **Version identifier (L4)**: Package version "2024.02.02" following date-based versioning scheme
- **Module exports control (L3)**: `__all__` list explicitly defines the public interface

## Dependencies
- **Internal dependency**: `.core` module containing the actual implementation of `contents` and `where` functions

## Architecture Notes
- **Facade pattern**: Acts as a clean interface layer over the core implementation
- **Minimal surface area**: Only two functions exposed, keeping the API simple
- **Vendored context**: This is a copy of certifi bundled within pip's vendor directory, isolated from system-wide certifi installations

## Key Functions (from core module)
- `contents`: Likely returns the certificate bundle data
- `where`: Likely returns the path to the certificate bundle file

## Critical Context
This module sits within pip's vendor tree, meaning it's a specific version of certifi that pip controls independently of system packages. The location suggests this is for a Linux x64 LLDB/Python environment within a Rust adapter context.
