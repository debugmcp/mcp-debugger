## Purpose
Version definition module for urllib3 library within pip's vendored dependencies. Serves as the single source of truth for package version information.

## Key Elements
- `__version__` (L2): String constant defining urllib3 version "1.26.18"

## Dependencies
None - standalone version definition file.

## Architectural Notes
- Protected by CODEOWNERS for controlled version management
- Part of pip's vendor tree, indicating this is a bundled copy of urllib3
- Version follows semantic versioning pattern (major.minor.patch)
- Located in Linux x64 LLDB Python environment, suggesting debugging/development context

## Usage Pattern
Standard Python version module pattern - `__version__` attribute accessed by package consumers and setup tools for version introspection.
