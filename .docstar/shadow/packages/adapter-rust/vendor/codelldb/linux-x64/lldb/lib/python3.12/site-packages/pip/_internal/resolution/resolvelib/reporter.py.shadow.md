## Primary Purpose
Implements progress reporting for pip's dependency resolution process, providing user feedback during potentially long-running backtracking operations and debugging capabilities.

## Key Classes and Functions

### PipReporter(BaseReporter) (L12-55)
Main production reporter that tracks rejection counts and provides progressive user feedback.

**Constructor (L13-33):**
- Initializes `reject_count_by_package` defaultdict to track per-package rejection counts
- Defines `_messages_at_reject_count` dictionary mapping rejection thresholds (1, 8, 13) to increasingly urgent user messages

**rejecting_candidate() (L35-55):**
- Increments rejection counter for the candidate's package
- Triggers informational messages at specific rejection count thresholds
- Logs detailed conflict information showing dependency chain causing rejection
- Uses `candidate.name`, `parent.name`, `parent.version`, and `req.format_for_error()` for context

### PipDebuggingReporter(BaseReporter) (L58-80)
Verbose debugging reporter that logs all resolver events for troubleshooting.

**Methods (L61-80):**
- `starting()` (L61-62): Logs resolver start
- `starting_round(index)` (L64-65): Logs round begin with index
- `ending_round(index, state)` (L67-68): Logs round completion
- `ending(state)` (L70-71): Logs resolver completion
- `adding_requirement(requirement, parent)` (L73-74): Logs requirement addition
- `rejecting_candidate(criterion, candidate)` (L76-77): Logs candidate rejection
- `pinning(candidate)` (L79-80): Logs candidate selection

## Dependencies
- `BaseReporter` from `pip._vendor.resolvelib.reporters` - Abstract base class
- `Candidate`, `Requirement` from `.base` - Core resolver types
- Standard library: `collections.defaultdict`, `logging.getLogger`, `typing`

## Architectural Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Both reporters extend BaseReporter to receive resolver event notifications
- **Progressive Disclosure**: PipReporter shows increasingly detailed messages as rejection count grows
- **Separation of Concerns**: Production vs debugging reporters serve different use cases

## Critical Behavior
- PipReporter only shows messages at rejection counts 1, 8, and 13 to avoid spam
- Messages reference backtracking documentation and suggest Ctrl+C to abort
- Debugging reporter logs every event, suitable for development/troubleshooting only
