## Purpose
Implements wheel distribution handling for pip's package installation system. Provides a concrete implementation of AbstractDistribution for wheel files that require no build preparation since wheels are pre-built packages.

## Key Components

**WheelDistribution (L16-42)** - Main class representing a wheel distribution
- Inherits from AbstractDistribution 
- Designed for direct unpacking without build preparation
- Handles metadata extraction from wheel files

**build_tracker_id property (L22-24)** - Returns None since wheels don't need build tracking

**get_metadata_distribution method (L26-34)** - Core functionality for metadata extraction
- Creates FilesystemWheel from local file path
- Uses get_wheel_distribution with canonicalized package name
- Includes assertions for required wheel properties (local_file_path, name)

**prepare_distribution_metadata method (L36-42)** - No-op implementation
- Takes PackageFinder, build_isolation, and check_build_deps parameters
- Empty implementation since wheels need no preparation

## Dependencies
- pip._vendor.packaging.utils.canonicalize_name for name normalization
- pip._internal.distributions.base.AbstractDistribution as base class
- pip._internal.metadata for wheel handling utilities (BaseDistribution, FilesystemWheel, get_wheel_distribution)

## Architectural Decisions
- Minimal implementation leveraging wheel's pre-built nature
- Delegation to metadata utilities rather than direct wheel parsing
- Clear separation between wheel handling and build-required distributions
