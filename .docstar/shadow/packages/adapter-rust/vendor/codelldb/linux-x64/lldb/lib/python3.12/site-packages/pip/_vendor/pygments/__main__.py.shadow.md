## Primary Purpose
Entry point module for running Pygments as a command-line application via `python -m pygments`. This is a minimal wrapper that handles module execution and graceful keyboard interrupt handling.

## Key Components
- **Module execution wrapper (L14-17)**: Invokes the main command-line interface from `pip._vendor.pygments.cmdline.main()` with command-line arguments and handles system exit codes
- **Keyboard interrupt handler (L16-17)**: Catches Ctrl+C interruptions and exits cleanly with status code 1

## Dependencies
- **sys module (L11)**: Standard library module for system-specific parameters and functions, used for argv access and exit handling
- **pip._vendor.pygments.cmdline.main (L12)**: Core command-line interface function that processes Pygments commands

## Architecture Pattern
Follows Python's standard `__main__.py` pattern for making packages executable as modules. The implementation is minimal and defensive, ensuring clean exits under both normal and interrupted conditions.

## Critical Behavior
- Passes all command-line arguments directly to the main cmdline handler
- Propagates the exit code from the main function to the system
- Ensures keyboard interrupts result in exit code 1 (indicating abnormal termination)
- No error handling beyond KeyboardInterrupt, allowing other exceptions to propagate normally
