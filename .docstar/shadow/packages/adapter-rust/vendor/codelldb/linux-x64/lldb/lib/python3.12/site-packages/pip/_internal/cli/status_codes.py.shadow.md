**Purpose**: Defines standardized exit status codes for pip CLI operations, providing consistent error reporting across the pip package management tool.

**Key Constants**:
- `SUCCESS` (L1): Standard success exit code (0) - indicates pip command completed successfully
- `ERROR` (L2): Generic error exit code (1) - catchall for general pip failures
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` (L2): Unexpected error exit code (2) - for unhandled exceptions or system failures
- `VIRTUALENV_NOT_FOUND` (L4): Virtual environment missing exit code (3) - when pip cannot locate required virtual environment
- `PREVIOUS_BUILD_DIR_ERROR` (L5): Build directory conflict exit code (4) - when previous build artifacts interfere with current operation
- `NO_MATCHES_FOUND` (L6): No package matches exit code (23) - when pip search/install finds no matching packages

**Usage Pattern**: These constants are imported by pip's CLI modules and returned as process exit codes, allowing shell scripts and CI systems to programmatically handle different pip failure scenarios.

**Architecture Notes**: 
- Follows Unix exit code conventions (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- Uses specific numeric codes for different failure modes to enable granular error handling
- Gap in numbering (4 to 23) suggests historical evolution or reserved codes
