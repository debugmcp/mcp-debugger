@generated: 2026-02-09T18:16:12Z

## Overall Purpose

This directory contains the `pkg_resources` module - a deprecated but still widely-used package resource management system that provides access to package metadata, data files, and entry points. This is a vendored copy within pip's distribution, maintained for backward compatibility while directing users toward modern alternatives like `importlib.resources`, `importlib.metadata`, and `packaging`.

## Core Architecture & Components

The module implements a comprehensive package ecosystem management system built around several key architectural patterns:

### Central Registry System
- **WorkingSet**: The primary registry that tracks all active distributions on `sys.path`, managing dependency resolution, version conflicts, and entry point discovery
- **Environment**: Provides searchable snapshots of available distributions with platform and version filtering capabilities
- **Distribution**: Represents individual installed packages with lazy-loaded metadata, dependency mapping, and resource access

### Resource Provider Hierarchy
A pluggable system for accessing package data across different storage formats:
- **IResourceProvider/IMetadataProvider**: Protocol interfaces defining the contract
- **Provider implementations**: NullProvider (base), DefaultProvider (filesystem), ZipProvider (ZIP/egg files), EggProvider (virtual filesystems)
- Adapts different PEP 302 loaders to a unified resource access interface

### Entry Point System
- **EntryPoint**: Manages advertised importable objects with dynamic loading capabilities
- Pattern-based parsing from `entry_points.txt` files
- Group-based organization enabling plugin architectures and console script discovery

## Key Public API Surface

### Distribution Management
- `working_set`: Global registry of active distributions
- `get_distribution()`: Retrieve specific package distributions
- `require()`: Ensure specific packages are available and activated

### Resource Access
- `resource_string/stream/filename()`: Access package data files
- `resource_listdir()`: Enumerate package resources
- Global resource functions providing unified access across storage formats

### Entry Points & Plugin Discovery
- `iter_entry_points()`: Discover and iterate over entry points by group
- Entry point loading with automatic dependency resolution
- Console script and plugin enumeration

### Requirement Processing
- **Requirement**: Extended requirement parsing and compatibility checking
- Version conflict resolution and dependency graph management
- Platform compatibility and marker evaluation

## Internal Organization & Data Flow

### Discovery & Registration Flow
1. **Path Scanning**: Distributions discovered via `find_distributions()` across `sys.path`
2. **Metadata Loading**: Lazy parsing of PKG-INFO/METADATA files for version and dependency information
3. **Registry Management**: WorkingSet maintains canonical name mapping and precedence rules
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Version compatibility checking and dependency graph validation

### Resource Access Flow
1. **Provider Selection**: Appropriate provider chosen based on package storage format
2. **Resource Location**: Path normalization and validation within package boundaries  
3. **Data Extraction**: Content retrieval from filesystem, ZIP archives, or virtual filesystems
4. **Caching**: Resource path normalization cached for performance

### Namespace Package Support
- Legacy namespace package declaration and path management
- Handler registration for different importer types
- Sys.path reconstruction maintaining proper precedence

## Critical Patterns & Conventions

### State Management
- Global state serialization support for distribution registries
- Lazy loading patterns throughout for performance optimization
- Registry pattern for finders, loaders, and namespace handlers

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception hierarchy: ResolutionError, VersionConflict, DistributionNotFound
- Graceful degradation for parsing failures with sanitized fallbacks
- Platform compatibility checking with detailed conflict reporting

### Compatibility & Migration
- Active deprecation warnings directing users to modern alternatives
- Maintained API compatibility for legacy codebases
- Integration points with pip's internal utilities and packaging infrastructure

This module serves as a critical compatibility layer in the Python packaging ecosystem, bridging legacy package management approaches with modern tooling while providing essential functionality for plugin systems, resource access, and dependency management.
