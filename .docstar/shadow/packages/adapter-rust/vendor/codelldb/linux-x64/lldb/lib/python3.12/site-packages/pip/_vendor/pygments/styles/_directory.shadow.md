@generated: 2026-02-09T18:16:06Z

## Overall Purpose
This directory implements the styles subsystem for the Pygments syntax highlighting library. It provides a complete style management framework that enables discovery, loading, and access to syntax highlighting color schemes and themes. The module serves as the bridge between Pygments' core highlighting engine and the visual presentation layer.

## Key Components and Architecture

### Style Registry System
The directory implements a two-tier style registry:
- **`_mapping.py`**: Auto-generated central registry containing 49+ built-in styles mapped to their module locations
- **`__init__.py`**: Dynamic style resolver that orchestrates style discovery and loading

### Style Resolution Chain
The module implements a sophisticated fallback resolution system:
1. **Built-in Styles**: Primary lookup via `_STYLE_NAME_TO_MODULE_MAP` derived from the central registry
2. **Plugin Discovery**: Secondary lookup through Pygments' plugin system via `find_plugin_styles()`
3. **Dynamic Discovery**: Tertiary fallback for styles dropped directly into the styles package directory

## Public API Surface

### Primary Entry Points
- **`get_style_by_name(name)`**: Main style resolver function - takes a style name and returns the corresponding style class
- **`get_all_styles()`**: Generator that yields all available style names from all sources (built-in + plugins)

### Legacy Interface
- **`STYLE_MAP`**: Deprecated dictionary mapping style names to module::class format strings (maintained for backwards compatibility)

## Internal Organization and Data Flow

### Style Loading Process
1. Style name received via `get_style_by_name()`
2. Lookup in built-in registry (`_STYLE_NAME_TO_MODULE_MAP`)
3. If not found, query plugin system for external styles
4. If still not found, attempt dynamic module discovery with `{name.title()}Style` convention
5. Import target module and extract style class
6. Return style class or raise `ClassNotFound` exception

### Data Flow Patterns
- **Lazy Loading**: Style classes are only imported when explicitly requested
- **Caching**: Built-in styles use pre-computed mappings for efficient lookup
- **Error Propagation**: Import errors are caught and converted to domain-specific exceptions

## Important Patterns and Conventions

### Style Naming Convention
- Style classes follow `[Name]Style` pattern (e.g., `GruvboxDarkStyle`)
- Style names are case-sensitive in lookups
- Plugin styles can override naming conventions

### Registry Management
- `_mapping.py` is auto-generated and must not be manually edited
- Regeneration via `tox -e mapfiles` ensures synchronization with actual implementations
- Registry format: `'StyleClass': ('module.path', 'alias', metadata_tuple)`

### Multi-Source Architecture
The directory seamlessly integrates three style sources:
- **Built-in styles**: Shipped with Pygments, covering major themes and editor styles
- **Plugin styles**: External packages that extend Pygments via entry points
- **Dynamic styles**: Ad-hoc styles added directly to the styles package

This architecture enables both comprehensive out-of-the-box theming and extensibility for custom styling needs.
