## Overall Purpose
This directory contains pip's vendored copy of the `certifi` library, which provides programmatic access to Mozilla's curated CA certificate bundle. As a vendored dependency, this ensures pip has a reliable, isolated source of trusted root certificates for SSL/TLS verification, independent of system-wide certifi installations.

## Key Components & Architecture

**Entry Points & Public API:**
- **`__init__.py`**: Primary public interface exposing two core functions via facade pattern:
  - `where()`: Returns filesystem path to the certificate bundle
  - `contents()`: Returns certificate bundle data as string
- **`__main__.py`**: CLI entry point (`python -m pip._vendor.certifi`) with optional `-c/--contents` flag
- **`core.py`**: Implementation layer handling cross-Python version compatibility and resource management

**Internal Organization & Data Flow:**
1. **Public API Layer** (`__init__.py`): Clean facade importing from core implementation
2. **CLI Interface** (`__main__.py`): Simple argument parsing routing to core functions
3. **Implementation Core** (`core.py`): Version-aware resource loading with lazy initialization

**Cross-Python Compatibility Strategy:**
- **Python 3.11+**: Modern `importlib.resources.files()` API with context managers
- **Python 3.7-3.10**: Older `importlib.resources.path()` API with context managers
- **Python <3.7**: Filesystem fallback using direct `__file__` resolution

## Key Patterns & Conventions

**Resource Management:**
- **Lazy Loading**: Certificate bundle extraction deferred until first access
- **Singleton Caching**: Global state prevents repeated file extraction operations  
- **Context Manager Lifecycle**: Proper cleanup via `atexit` registration for importlib contexts
- **Zipimport Support**: Handles certificate access when pip is installed as wheel/zip

**API Design:**
- **Minimal Surface Area**: Only two public functions (`where`, `contents`) 
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same API across all Python versions despite different underlying implementations
- **CLI Convenience**: Default behavior shows file path, `-c` flag shows contents

## Critical Context
Located within `packages/adapter-rust/vendor/codelldb/linux-x64/lldb/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_vendor/`, this represents a deeply nested vendored dependency chain. The module ensures SSL certificate verification capabilities are available in specialized development environments (Rust adapter → LLDB → Python → pip) where system certificates might not be accessible or reliable.

The version identifier "2024.02.02" follows Mozilla's CA certificate bundle release cycle, ensuring up-to-date root certificate authority trust anchors for secure communications.
