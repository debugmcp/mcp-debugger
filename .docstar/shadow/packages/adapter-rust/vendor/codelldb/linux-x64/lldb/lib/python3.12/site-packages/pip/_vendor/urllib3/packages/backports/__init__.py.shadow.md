**Primary Purpose**: Empty package initializer for urllib3's backports module. This file serves as a standard Python package marker to make the `backports` directory importable as a module.

**Architecture**: 
- No code implementation - purely structural
- Part of urllib3's vendored dependencies within pip
- Located in a deep dependency chain: pip → urllib3 → backports
- Enables backport compatibility modules to be organized under a common namespace

**Dependencies**: None (empty file)

**Key Characteristics**:
- Zero-content `__init__.py` following Python packaging conventions
- Allows import statements like `from pip._vendor.urllib3.packages.backports import <module>`
- Typically contains backported functionality for older Python versions when populated

**Usage Context**: 
- Part of pip's vendored urllib3 library within a Python 3.12 environment
- Likely contains backports of newer Python features for compatibility with older versions
- Common pattern in vendored libraries to isolate backport dependencies
