## Purpose
Defines the data model for Python package installation schemes, representing the directory structure where different types of package artifacts are installed.

## Key Components

### Constants
- **SCHEME_KEYS** (L10): List of standard installation directory categories: `["platlib", "purelib", "headers", "scripts", "data"]`

### Classes
- **Scheme** (L13-25): Immutable dataclass representing installation directory paths
  - Frozen dataclass with `__slots__` optimization using SCHEME_KEYS
  - Fields correspond to Python installation scheme directories:
    - `platlib`: Platform-specific library files
    - `purelib`: Pure Python library files  
    - `headers`: C/C++ header files
    - `scripts`: Executable scripts
    - `data`: Data files
  - All fields are string paths

## Architecture Notes
- Uses dataclass with `frozen=True` for immutability
- `__slots__` definition provides memory optimization by restricting attribute creation
- Aligns with Python's standard installation scheme categories defined in PEP 427 and sysconfig

## Dependencies
- `dataclasses.dataclass`: For structured data representation

## Usage Context
Part of pip's internal package installation system, used to determine where different types of package files should be installed based on the target environment's scheme configuration.
