This file is an empty package initializer (`__init__.py`) for the `urllib3.packages` module within pip's vendored dependencies.

**Primary Purpose:**
- Marks the `packages` directory as a Python package
- Provides namespace for urllib3's vendored third-party dependencies
- Allows imports from the packages subdirectory

**Structure:**
- Contains no code, classes, or functions
- Serves purely as a package marker
- Typical pattern for organizing vendored/bundled dependencies

**Context:**
- Located within pip's vendored urllib3 distribution
- Part of the dependency isolation strategy where pip bundles its own copies of libraries
- The `packages` directory typically contains vendored versions of libraries like `six`, `certifi`, etc.

**Usage Pattern:**
This empty init file enables imports like:
```python
from pip._vendor.urllib3.packages import six
from pip._vendor.urllib3.packages import certifi
```

**Architectural Role:**
- Maintains clean separation between urllib3's core functionality and its dependencies
- Prevents conflicts with system-installed versions of the same packages
- Supports pip's self-contained distribution model
