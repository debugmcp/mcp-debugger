**Primary Purpose**: Simple date comparison utility for pip's internal operations, providing a clean interface to check if the current date is later than a specified date.

**Core Functionality**:
- `today_is_later_than(year, month, day)` (L7-11): Takes date components as integers and returns boolean indicating if today's date is chronologically after the given date. Uses `datetime.date.today()` for current date and `datetime.date()` constructor for comparison date.

**Dependencies**: 
- `datetime` module from Python standard library (L4)

**Usage Pattern**: 
This utility appears designed for version checks, deprecation warnings, or time-based feature flags within pip's codebase. The function signature suggests it's optimized for hardcoded date comparisons rather than dynamic date objects.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Uses simple greater-than comparison between `datetime.date` objects (L11)
- No error handling for invalid date inputs (could raise `ValueError` for invalid dates)
- Returns strict inequality (today > given), so same-day returns `False`
