**Purpose**: Utility module for identifying and classifying file types based on extensions, specifically focused on archive formats commonly used in Python package distribution.

**Key Constants**:
- `WHEEL_EXTENSION` (L8): Single wheel file extension ".whl" 
- `BZ2_EXTENSIONS` (L9): Tuple of bzip2 compressed archive extensions
- `XZ_EXTENSIONS` (L10-16): Tuple of XZ/LZMA compressed archive extensions including various tar combinations
- `ZIP_EXTENSIONS` (L17): Combines ZIP and wheel extensions
- `TAR_EXTENSIONS` (L18): Standard tar archive extensions including gzipped variants
- `ARCHIVE_EXTENSIONS` (L19): Master collection combining all supported archive types

**Key Functions**:
- `is_archive_file(name: str) -> bool` (L22-27): Determines if a filename represents a supported archive format by checking its lowercased extension against `ARCHIVE_EXTENSIONS`

**Dependencies**:
- `pip._internal.utils.misc.splitext`: Custom splitext function for filename parsing
- `typing.Tuple`: Type annotation support

**Architecture Notes**:
- Uses tuple constants for immutable extension definitions
- Case-insensitive matching via `.lower()` transformation
- Modular design allows easy extension of supported formats
- Separates different compression/archive types for maintainability

**Usage Context**: Part of pip's internal utilities for handling various package archive formats during installation and processing.
