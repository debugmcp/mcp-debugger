## Purpose
Models Python package index endpoints for pip's internal operations, providing structured access to PyPI and TestPyPI URLs.

## Key Components

### PackageIndex (L4-23)
Core class representing a package repository with pre-computed endpoint URLs.

**Attributes:**
- `url` (L11): Base index URL
- `netloc` (L12): Network location extracted from base URL
- `simple_url` (L13): Simple API endpoint for package discovery
- `pypi_url` (L14): PyPI API endpoint
- `file_storage_domain` (L19): Domain for package file storage (security constraint)

**Methods:**
- `__init__(url, file_storage_domain)` (L9-19): Initializes index with base URL and computes derived endpoints
- `_url_for_path(path)` (L21-22): Helper for joining paths to base URL

### Global Instances
- `PyPI` (L25): Production PyPI index instance
- `TestPyPI` (L26-28): Test PyPI index instance

## Dependencies
- `urllib.parse`: URL manipulation and parsing

## Architecture Notes
- Uses `__slots__` (L7) for memory efficiency
- File storage domain serves as temporary security mechanism to block packages with external dependencies
- Pre-computes commonly used endpoints during initialization to avoid repeated URL construction

## Usage Pattern
Provides standardized interface for accessing different package index environments with consistent URL generation.
