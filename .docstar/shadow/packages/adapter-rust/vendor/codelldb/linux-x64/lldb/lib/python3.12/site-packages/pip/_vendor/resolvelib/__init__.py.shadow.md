## Purpose
Package initialization file for the ResolveLib library, a dependency resolution library used by pip. Serves as the main public API entry point by re-exporting core components and defining the package version.

## Public API Structure
- **Version**: `__version__ = "1.0.1"` (L14) - Package version identifier
- **Exported Classes** (L1-12): Complete public API surface defined in `__all__`

### Core Components Re-exported
- **Abstract Base Classes** from `providers` module (L17):
  - `AbstractProvider` - Interface for package/dependency providers
  - `AbstractResolver` - Interface for resolution strategies
- **Reporter Base** from `reporters` module (L18):
  - `BaseReporter` - Base class for resolution progress reporting
- **Resolver Implementation** from `resolvers` module (L19-26):
  - `Resolver` - Main dependency resolution engine
  - Exception hierarchy:
    - `ResolutionError` - Base resolution error
    - `ResolutionImpossible` - Unsolvable dependency constraints
    - `ResolutionTooDeep` - Recursion/complexity limits exceeded
    - `RequirementsConflicted` - Conflicting version requirements
    - `InconsistentCandidate` - Invalid candidate state

## Architecture
Follows standard Python package pattern with clean separation of concerns:
- `providers` - Abstraction layer for data sources
- `reporters` - Progress/event reporting interfaces  
- `resolvers` - Core resolution logic and error handling

The module acts as a facade, providing a single import point for all public ResolveLib functionality while maintaining internal module organization.
