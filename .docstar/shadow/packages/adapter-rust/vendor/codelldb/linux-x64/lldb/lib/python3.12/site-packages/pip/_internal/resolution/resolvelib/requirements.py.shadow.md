This module implements concrete requirement types for pip's ResolveLib-based dependency resolution system. It provides different requirement representations that the resolver uses to find and validate candidate packages.

**Core Classes:**

**ExplicitRequirement (L12-48)** - Represents a requirement for a specific, already-identified candidate package. Used when the resolver needs to pin a requirement to an exact candidate. Key methods:
- `is_satisfied_by()` (L46) - Only satisfied by the exact same candidate
- `get_candidate_lookup()` (L43) - Returns the pinned candidate directly

**SpecifierRequirement (L50-120)** - Represents a requirement with version specifiers (e.g., "package>=1.0,<2.0"). The primary requirement type for normal dependency resolution. Features:
- Caching for equality comparisons (`_equal_cache` L54) and hashing (`_hash` L55) for performance
- `format_for_error()` (L93-104) - Converts comma-separated specifiers to human-readable format ("A, B and C")
- `is_satisfied_by()` (L109) - Uses packaging.specifiers to validate candidate versions against requirements
- Handles extras through `_extras` frozenset (L56)

**SpecifierWithoutExtrasRequirement (L122-154)** - Specialized variant that strips extras from install requirements using `install_req_drop_extras()`. Used for base package requirements when extras are handled separately.

**RequiresPythonRequirement (L156-208)** - Handles Python version requirements from package metadata. Special behavior:
- `get_candidate_lookup()` (L197) - Returns candidate only if current Python version satisfies the requirement
- Always allows prereleases since PackageFinder handles prerelease filtering

**UnsatisfiableRequirement (L210-245)** - Represents requirements that cannot be satisfied (e.g., unavailable packages). Always returns `False` from `is_satisfied_by()` (L244).

**Key Dependencies:**
- `pip._vendor.packaging` - For version specifier handling and name canonicalization
- `pip._internal.req` - For InstallRequirement integration
- `.base` - Base Requirement/Candidate interfaces and utilities

**Architectural Patterns:**
- All requirement classes implement the Requirement interface from `.base`
- Heavy use of caching for performance-critical operations (equality, hashing)
- Consistent error formatting across requirement types
- CandidateLookup tuple return pattern for resolver integration
