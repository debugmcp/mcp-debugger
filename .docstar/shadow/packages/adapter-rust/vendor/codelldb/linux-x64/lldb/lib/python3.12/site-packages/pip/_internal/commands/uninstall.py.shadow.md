**Purpose**: Implements pip's package uninstall command functionality, handling removal of installed Python packages with safety checks and user confirmation options.

**Core Class**: 
- `UninstallCommand` (L26-114): Main command class inheriting from Command and SessionCommandMixin, responsible for parsing uninstall requests and executing package removal

**Key Methods**:
- `add_options()` (L41-63): Configures command-line options including `-r/--requirement` for requirements files, `-y/--yes` for auto-confirmation, and safety flags for externally managed environments
- `run()` (L65-114): Main execution logic that processes package names and requirements files, performs safety checks, and orchestrates the uninstall process

**Processing Flow**:
1. Collects packages from command-line args (L69-82) and requirements files (L83-91)
2. Canonicalizes package names using `canonicalize_name()` to handle duplicates
3. Validates at least one package is specified (L92-96)
4. Performs safety checks: externally managed environments (L98-99) and Windows pip protection (L101-103)
5. Executes uninstall for each package with optional auto-confirmation (L105-111)

**Dependencies**:
- Uses pip's internal CLI framework (`base_command`, `cmdoptions`)
- Leverages requirement parsing utilities (`parse_requirements`, `install_req_from_*`)
- Integrates safety utilities for root warnings and externally managed environments

**Safety Mechanisms**:
- Prevents uninstalling from externally managed Python installations unless overridden
- Protects pip self-modification on Windows
- Warns when running as root user
- Validates package names and ignores invalid requirements

**Return Value**: Always returns `SUCCESS` status code after completing uninstall operations.
