## Purpose
Generates structured installation reports for pip package installations, providing detailed metadata about installed packages in a standardized JSON format compliant with PEP specifications.

## Core Components

**InstallationReport (L9-56)**
- Main class that aggregates installation requirements and converts them to structured reports
- Constructor (L10-11): Takes sequence of InstallRequirement objects
- Primary output method: `to_dict()` (L42-56) produces complete installation report

**Key Methods**

**_install_req_to_dict() (L14-40)**
- Class method converting individual InstallRequirement to dictionary representation
- Extracts PEP 610 download information, direct installation flags, yanked status
- Includes PEP 566 metadata and user-requested extras for top-level requirements
- Critical assertion (L15): Validates download_info presence

**to_dict() (L42-56)**
- Generates complete installation report with version info, pip version, and environment markers
- Uses default environment for marker evaluation (currently limitation noted in TODO)

## Dependencies
- `pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement`: Core requirement objects
- `pip._vendor.packaging.markers.default_environment`: Environment marker evaluation
- `pip.__version__`: Version tracking

## Data Structure
Report format includes:
- Version identifier and pip version
- Array of install requirement dictionaries with download info, direct/yanked flags, metadata
- Environment markers for dependency resolution context

## Architecture Notes
- Follows PEP standards: PEP 610 (download URLs), PEP 566 (metadata), PEP 503 (indexes), PEP 592 (yanked packages)
- Designed for consumption by external tools analyzing pip installations
- Environment evaluation currently uses defaults (noted limitation for future enhancement)
