## Purpose and Responsibility
This is a minimal subpackage that provides access to the `_in_process.py` script resource while avoiding module shadowing conflicts. The subpackage is specifically designed to be lightweight to prevent interference with backend module imports during in-process operations.

## Key Components
- **`_in_proc_script_path()` function (L13-14 or L16-18)**: Returns a context manager for accessing the `_in_process.py` script file resource. Implementation varies based on Python version compatibility.

## Dependencies
- `importlib.resources`: Core module for accessing package resources
- `__package__`: Built-in variable used to reference the current package for resource resolution

## Architecture and Patterns
- **Version compatibility pattern (L9-18)**: Uses feature detection (`try/except AttributeError`) to handle differences between Python versions
- **Python 3.8 compatibility (L13-14)**: Uses deprecated `resources.path()` when `resources.files()` is unavailable
- **Modern implementation (L16-18)**: Uses `resources.files().joinpath()` with `as_file()` for newer Python versions
- **Resource management**: Both implementations return context managers for proper file handle cleanup

## Critical Constraints
- Package must remain minimal to avoid shadowing modules that backends might import
- Must maintain compatibility across Python versions (3.8+)
- Provides controlled access to the `_in_process.py` script resource
