## Purpose
This file serves as an initialization module for pip's internal index interaction functionality. It acts as a package marker and entry point for the `pip._internal.index` package.

## Structure
The file contains only a module-level docstring (L1-2) that briefly describes the package's purpose as handling "Index interaction code". No classes, functions, or imports are present.

## Dependencies
No explicit dependencies or imports are defined in this file.

## Architectural Role
This is a standard Python package `__init__.py` file that enables the `pip._internal.index` directory to be treated as a Python package. The actual index interaction functionality is likely implemented in other modules within this package directory.

## Key Characteristics
- Minimal implementation with only documentation
- Follows Python package structure conventions
- Acts as namespace declaration for index-related functionality
