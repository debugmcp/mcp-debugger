## Purpose
Provides infinity and negative infinity singleton classes for comparison operations in Python packaging version handling. These types act as mathematical infinities that compare correctly with all other objects.

## Key Classes

### InfinityType (L6-30)
Singleton class representing positive infinity with comparison operators that ensure it's always greater than any other object (except itself).

**Key methods:**
- `__repr__()` (L7-8): Returns "Infinity" string representation
- `__hash__()` (L10-11): Hash based on string representation for dictionary/set usage
- `__lt__/__le__()` (L13-17): Always returns False (infinity is never less than anything)
- `__eq__()` (L19-20): True only for other InfinityType instances
- `__gt__/__ge__()` (L22-26): Always returns True (infinity is always greater)
- `__neg__()` (L28-29): Returns NegativeInfinity singleton when negated

### NegativeInfinityType (L35-59)
Singleton class representing negative infinity with comparison operators that ensure it's always less than any other object (except itself).

**Key methods:**
- `__repr__()` (L36-37): Returns "-Infinity" string representation
- `__hash__()` (L39-40): Hash based on string representation
- `__lt__/__le__()` (L42-46): Always returns True (negative infinity is always less)
- `__eq__()` (L48-49): True only for other NegativeInfinityType instances
- `__gt__/__ge__()` (L51-55): Always returns False (never greater than anything)
- `__neg__()` (L57-58): Returns Infinity singleton when negated

## Singleton Instances
- `Infinity` (L32): Global singleton instance of InfinityType
- `NegativeInfinity` (L61): Global singleton instance of NegativeInfinityType

## Usage Pattern
These classes implement the singleton pattern via module-level instances, providing mathematical infinity behavior for version comparison operations. The symmetric negation relationship between the two types allows bidirectional conversion.

## Dependencies
No external dependencies - uses only Python built-ins for type checking and hashing.
