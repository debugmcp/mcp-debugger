**Purpose**: Network utilities module initialization file for pip's internal networking functionality.

**Structure**: This is a minimal module __init__.py file that serves as the entry point for pip's network-related utilities package. The file contains only a docstring (L1-2) declaring the module's purpose.

**Key Elements**: 
- Module docstring (L1-2): Declares this package contains "purely network-related utilities"

**Dependencies**: None explicitly imported in this file.

**Architectural Role**: Acts as a namespace package marker for pip's internal network utilities. Other modules in this package likely contain the actual network functionality (HTTP clients, download managers, authentication handlers, etc.).

**Usage Pattern**: This follows Python's standard package initialization pattern where __init__.py files can be minimal and serve primarily to make a directory into a Python package.

**Critical Notes**: The minimal nature suggests actual network functionality is implemented in sibling modules within the same package directory.
