**Primary Purpose**: Concrete implementation of AbstractDistribution for packages that are already installed on the system, requiring no preparation or building steps.

**Core Class**:
- `InstalledDistribution` (L8-29): Concrete distribution class for already-installed packages
  - Inherits from `AbstractDistribution` to implement the distribution interface
  - Represents packages that exist in the current environment and need no further processing

**Key Methods**:
- `build_tracker_id` property (L15-17): Always returns None since installed packages don't need build tracking
- `get_metadata_distribution()` (L19-21): Returns the satisfied requirement's BaseDistribution with assertion check
- `prepare_distribution_metadata()` (L23-29): No-op implementation since installed packages require no preparation

**Dependencies**:
- `AbstractDistribution`: Base class providing distribution interface
- `PackageFinder`: Used in method signature but not actually utilized
- `BaseDistribution`: Metadata interface returned by get_metadata_distribution

**Architectural Pattern**: 
- Null Object pattern for preparation methods - installed distributions need no preparation
- Template Method pattern implementation where preparation steps are no-ops

**Critical Invariant**: 
- `self.req.satisfied_by` must not be None when `get_metadata_distribution()` is called (enforced by assertion L20)

**Usage Context**: Part of pip's distribution handling system, specifically for cases where packages are already present in the environment and don't require downloading, building, or metadata preparation.
