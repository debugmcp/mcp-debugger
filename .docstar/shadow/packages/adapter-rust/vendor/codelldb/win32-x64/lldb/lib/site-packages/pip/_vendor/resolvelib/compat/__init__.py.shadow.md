## Purpose and Responsibility
Empty compatibility module for resolvelib package. Serves as a placeholder `__init__.py` file to make the `compat` directory a valid Python package.

## Structure
The file contains no code - completely empty. This is a standard pattern for compatibility modules that may contain version-specific implementations in submodules or serve as future extension points.

## Dependencies
None - no imports or code present.

## Architectural Notes
- Located within pip's vendored copy of resolvelib library
- Part of the compatibility layer infrastructure for resolvelib
- Empty package structure suggests conditional imports or platform-specific implementations may exist in sibling modules
- Standard Python package initialization pattern
