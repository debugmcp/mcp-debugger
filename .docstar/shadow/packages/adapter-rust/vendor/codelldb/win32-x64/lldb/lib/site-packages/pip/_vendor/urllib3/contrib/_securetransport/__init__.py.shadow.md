**Primary Purpose**: Empty Python package initialization file for the `_securetransport` module within urllib3's contrib section.

**Functionality**: This is a standard Python `__init__.py` file that serves to make the `_securetransport` directory a valid Python package. The file is completely empty, containing no code, classes, functions, or imports.

**Context**: Located within the urllib3 library's contrib section, this package likely relates to macOS/iOS SecureTransport SSL/TLS backend functionality, though this particular init file provides no implementation details.

**Dependencies**: None - the file contains no imports or code.

**Architectural Role**: Serves as a package marker in the Python module hierarchy, allowing imports from `pip._vendor.urllib3.contrib._securetransport` namespace.
