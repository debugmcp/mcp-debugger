## Purpose
Empty package initialization file for pip's vendored urllib3 packages module. Serves as a marker to make the `packages` directory a Python package within the urllib3 vendor hierarchy.

## Structure
This is an empty `__init__.py` file with no code content, classes, functions, or imports.

## Context
Located within pip's vendored dependencies (`pip/_vendor/urllib3/packages/`), this file is part of the urllib3 HTTP client library that has been bundled with pip to avoid external dependencies. The packages directory likely contains subpackages or modules that extend urllib3's functionality.

## Architectural Role
- Enables Python to treat the `packages` directory as a importable package
- Part of pip's vendor isolation strategy to bundle dependencies internally
- Maintains the urllib3 package structure within pip's vendor tree
