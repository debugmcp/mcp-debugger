## Purpose and Responsibility
This module provides reporter classes for pip's dependency resolver, implementing feedback mechanisms during the resolution process. It extends resolvelib's BaseReporter to provide pip-specific logging and user communication during dependency resolution.

## Key Classes and Functions

### PipReporter (L12-56)
Primary reporter class that tracks package rejection counts and provides progressive user feedback during resolution:
- `__init__` (L13-33): Initializes rejection tracking and defines user messages at specific rejection thresholds (1st, 8th, 13th rejection)
- `rejecting_candidate` (L35-55): Core method that increments rejection count per package and logs appropriate user messages based on rejection count milestones

Key attributes:
- `reject_count_by_package` (L14): DefaultDict tracking rejection counts per package name
- `_messages_at_reject_count` (L16-33): Static mapping of rejection counts to user-facing messages

### PipDebuggingReporter (L58-80)
Debugging-focused reporter that logs all resolver events:
- `starting` (L61-62): Logs resolution start
- `starting_round`/`ending_round` (L64-68): Logs resolution round boundaries
- `ending` (L70-71): Logs resolution completion
- `adding_requirement` (L73-74): Logs requirement additions
- `rejecting_candidate` (L76-77): Logs candidate rejections
- `pinning` (L79-80): Logs candidate selections

## Dependencies and Relationships
- Extends `BaseReporter` from pip._vendor.resolvelib.reporters
- Uses local types `Candidate` and `Requirement` from `.base` module
- Utilizes Python's `logging` module for output and `collections.defaultdict` for counting

## Architectural Patterns
- **Progressive Feedback**: PipReporter implements escalating user messages as rejection count increases
- **Observer Pattern**: Both reporters act as observers of the resolution process
- **Template Method**: Implements BaseReporter interface with pip-specific behavior

## Critical Behavior
- PipReporter only shows messages at specific rejection counts (1, 8, 13) to avoid spam
- Message at count 13 includes backtracking guidance and abort instructions
- Debug reporter logs all events regardless of frequency
- Rejection messages include dependency chain information for troubleshooting
