## Purpose and Responsibility
Compatibility layer package for the resolvelib library, providing cross-Python-version compatibility abstractions. This module ensures resolvelib can work consistently across different Python versions by handling API changes and deprecated imports that occurred between Python releases.

## Key Components
- **Package Structure (`__init__.py`)**: Empty initialization file that establishes the `compat` directory as a valid Python package within the resolvelib ecosystem
- **Collections Compatibility (`collections_abc.py`)**: Provides unified access to `Mapping` and `Sequence` abstract base classes, handling the Python 3.3+ transition from `collections` to `collections.abc`

## Public API Surface
The main entry point is through `collections_abc.py` which exports:
- `Mapping` - Abstract base class for mapping types (dict-like objects)
- `Sequence` - Abstract base class for sequence types (list-like objects)

These can be imported consistently as:
```python
from resolvelib.compat.collections_abc import Mapping, Sequence
```

## Internal Organization
The directory follows a standard Python compatibility pattern:
- Package-level initialization with empty `__init__.py`
- Module-specific compatibility shims (currently only `collections_abc.py`)
- Try-except import fallback pattern to handle version differences transparently

## Architectural Patterns
Implements the **compatibility shim pattern** where:
1. Modern Python API is attempted first
2. Legacy fallback is provided for older versions
3. Downstream code imports from a consistent location regardless of Python version
4. No runtime performance impact - compatibility resolved at import time

## Context in Larger System
This compatibility layer is part of pip's vendored copy of resolvelib, ensuring the dependency resolver can function across the wide range of Python versions that pip supports. The modular structure allows for easy addition of other compatibility abstractions as needed for different Python version requirements.
