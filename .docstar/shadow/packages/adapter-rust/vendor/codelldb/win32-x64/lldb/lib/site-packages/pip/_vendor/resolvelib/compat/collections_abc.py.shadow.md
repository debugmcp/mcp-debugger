## Purpose
Compatibility module providing a unified interface for importing `Mapping` and `Sequence` abstract base classes across different Python versions. Handles the transition from `collections` to `collections.abc` module that occurred in Python 3.3+.

## Key Components
- **__all__ declaration (L1)**: Explicitly exports `Mapping` and `Sequence` for public API
- **Import fallback logic (L3-6)**: Try-except block that:
  - First attempts modern import from `collections.abc` (L4) - Python 3.3+
  - Falls back to legacy `collections` import (L6) - Python < 3.3

## Dependencies
- `collections.abc` (modern Python versions)
- `collections` (legacy Python versions)

## Architectural Pattern
Classic Python compatibility shim using try-except import pattern. This allows downstream code to import these ABC classes consistently regardless of Python version, abstracting away the module location differences.

## Critical Constraints
- Must maintain exact same interface (`Mapping`, `Sequence`) regardless of source module
- Provides forward compatibility for code that needs to run on multiple Python versions
- No runtime overhead once imported - just establishes the correct binding
