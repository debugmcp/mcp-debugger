## Purpose
Environment detection module for Google App Engine applications within urllib3. Provides utilities to determine if code is running in various App Engine environments (local development, production, or legacy sandbox).

## Key Functions

**`is_appengine()` (L8-9)**: Main detection function that returns True if running in any App Engine environment (local or production).

**`is_appengine_sandbox()` (L12-19)**: Detects first-generation App Engine sandbox (Python 2.7 runtime). Uses environment variable `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` to identify restrictive legacy sandbox environments.

**`is_local_appengine()` (L22-25)**: Identifies local development environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Development/".

**`is_prod_appengine()` (L28-31)**: Identifies production App Engine environment by checking for `APPENGINE_RUNTIME` and `SERVER_SOFTWARE` starting with "Google App Engine/".

**`is_prod_appengine_mvms()` (L34-36)**: Deprecated function that always returns False.

## Dependencies
- `os`: For environment variable access

## Architecture Notes
- All detection logic relies on standard App Engine environment variables (`APPENGINE_RUNTIME`, `SERVER_SOFTWARE`)
- Functions use defensive programming with `.get()` and `.startswith()` to handle missing/malformed environment variables
- Clear separation between local development and production detection
- Legacy support maintained through sandbox detection for Python 2.7 environments

## Key Environment Variables
- `APPENGINE_RUNTIME`: Identifies App Engine runtime version
- `SERVER_SOFTWARE`: Contains server identification string for environment type detection
