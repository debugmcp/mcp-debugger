## Purpose and Responsibility
Auto-generated Unicode case-folding data table for regex pattern matching, specifically handling special characters that have multiple lowercase variants mapping to the same uppercase form.

## Core Data Structure
**`_EXTRA_CASES` dictionary (L5-106)**: Maps Unicode code points (integers) to tuples of alternative lowercase character codes that share the same uppercase equivalent. Critical for case-insensitive regex matching where standard case folding is insufficient.

## Character Categories Covered
- **Latin variants (L7-15, L91-93)**: Dotless i (ı/i), long s (ſ/s), and s with dot above variants
- **Greek characters (L11, L17-57)**: Extensive mappings including:
  - Micro sign ↔ Greek mu (L11, L33)
  - Greek letter variants ↔ symbol forms (beta, epsilon, theta, etc.)
  - Combining/standalone iota forms (L17, L29, L95)
  - Sigma variants including final sigma (L39-41)
- **Cyrillic variants (L59-89, L101)**: Multiple character variants (rounded, long-legged, narrow, wide, tall forms)
- **Latin ligatures (L103-105)**: Long s ligature variants

## Key Architectural Patterns
- Bidirectional mapping: Most entries have corresponding reverse mappings (e.g., L7↔L13, L39↔L41)
- Multi-target mappings: Some characters map to multiple alternatives (L17, L29, L67, L81-83, L95)
- Code point organization: Grouped by Unicode blocks (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic)

## Dependencies and Context
- Auto-generated by `Tools/build/generate_re_casefix.py` (L1)
- Part of Python's `re` module case-folding infrastructure
- Used internally by regex engine for case-insensitive pattern matching

## Critical Invariants
- All mappings are between lowercase characters only
- Bidirectional consistency maintained where applicable
- Unicode code points stored as integers, mapped to tuples for extensibility
