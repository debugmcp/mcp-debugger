This file implements the CP857 character encoding (Turkish PC code page) for Python's codec system. CP857 is a code page used primarily for Turkish text on MS-DOS systems, extending ASCII with Turkish-specific characters and box-drawing symbols.

## Primary Purpose
Provides complete bidirectional text encoding/decoding between Unicode and CP857 byte sequences through Python's standard codec framework. Generated automatically from Microsoft's CP857.TXT specification.

## Key Components

### Codec Classes (L9-42)
- **Codec (L9-15)**: Base codec with encode/decode methods using charmap functions
- **IncrementalEncoder (L17-19)**: Stream-based encoding support
- **IncrementalDecoder (L21-23)**: Stream-based decoding support  
- **StreamWriter (L25-26)**: File writing interface
- **StreamReader (L28-29)**: File reading interface
- **getregentry() (L33-42)**: Returns CodecInfo object for Python's encoding registry

### Character Mapping Tables

#### decoding_map (L46-175)
Dictionary mapping CP857 byte values (0x80-0xFF) to Unicode code points. Identity mapping for ASCII (0x00-0x7F), with special mappings for:
- Turkish characters (ç, ğ, ı, ş, ü and their capitals)
- Box drawing characters (0xB0-0xDF range)
- Mathematical symbols and currency signs
- Three undefined positions (0xD5, 0xE7, 0xF2) mapped to None

#### decoding_table (L179-436) 
String tuple containing 256 character mappings from CP857 bytes to Unicode strings. Provides direct lookup for decoder implementation.

#### encoding_map (L440-694)
Reverse mapping from Unicode code points to CP857 byte values. Contains ~130 mappings for non-ASCII characters, enabling Unicode→CP857 encoding.

## Character Set Coverage
- ASCII 0x00-0x7F: Identity mapping
- Turkish letters: ç, ğ, ı, ş, ü (both cases) plus accented vowels  
- Box drawing: Full set of single/double line characters
- Symbols: Currency signs, mathematical operators, fractions, ordinals
- Special: Three undefined code points that decode to replacement characters

## Usage Pattern
Integrates with Python's codec system via `getregentry()`. Supports all standard codec interfaces: direct encode/decode, incremental processing, and file I/O streams. Typical usage through `str.encode('cp857')` and `bytes.decode('cp857')`.
