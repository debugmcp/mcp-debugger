**Primary Purpose:** Module initialization file for pip's importlib-based metadata adapter, providing a clean interface to distribution and environment management components.

**Key Components:**
- `NAME = "importlib"` (L6): String constant identifying this metadata adapter implementation
- `Distribution` (L1): Imported from `_dists` module, handles individual package distribution metadata
- `Environment` (L2): Imported from `_envs` module, manages package environment discovery and querying

**Architecture:**
This is a standard Python package `__init__.py` that follows pip's metadata adapter pattern. The module exposes a minimal public API through `__all__` (L4), keeping internal implementation details in private submodules (`_dists`, `_envs`). The `NAME` constant allows runtime identification of which metadata backend is being used.

**Dependencies:**
- `._dists`: Contains Distribution class implementation
- `._envs`: Contains Environment class implementation

**Usage Pattern:**
This module serves as the entry point for pip's importlib-based metadata resolution system, which is one of several metadata adapters pip can use to discover and analyze installed packages. The importlib adapter leverages Python's built-in importlib.metadata capabilities.
