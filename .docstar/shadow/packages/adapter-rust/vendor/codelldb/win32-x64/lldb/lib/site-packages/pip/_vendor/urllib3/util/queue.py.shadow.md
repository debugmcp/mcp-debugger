## Purpose
Implements a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) queue for urllib3's connection pooling, extending Python's standard queue with stack-like behavior.

## Key Components
- **LifoQueue (L11-22)**: Custom queue implementation inheriting from `queue.Queue`
  - `_init()` (L12-13): Initializes with `collections.deque` as underlying storage
  - `_qsize()` (L15-16): Returns queue size using optimized `len` reference
  - `_put()` (L18-19): Adds items to end of deque (append operation)
  - `_get()` (L21-22): Removes and returns last item (pop operation for LIFO behavior)

## Dependencies
- `collections.deque`: High-performance double-ended queue for O(1) operations
- `six`: Python 2/3 compatibility layer
- `queue.Queue`: Base class providing thread-safe queue interface

## Architecture Notes
- Uses deque for efficient O(1) append/pop operations at both ends
- Inherits thread-safety mechanisms from `queue.Queue`
- Python 2 compatibility maintained via Queue import (L6-8)
- LIFO semantics achieved by appending at end and popping from end

## Use Case
Designed for connection pool management where most recently created connections should be reused first (better for connection freshness and resource locality).
