## Purpose
Package initialization module for pip's package installation operations. This is a minimal __init__.py file that serves as the entry point for the `pip._internal.operations.install` subpackage, which contains modules responsible for handling package installation workflows in pip.

## Structure
- **Module docstring (L1-2)**: Brief description indicating this package contains modules for package installation functionality
- No classes, functions, or imports defined in this file

## Dependencies
None explicitly imported or referenced.

## Architectural Role
Acts as a namespace package initializer within pip's internal operations structure. This follows pip's modular architecture where installation-related functionality is organized under the `operations.install` subpackage. The actual installation logic would be implemented in sibling modules within this package.

## Key Characteristics
- Minimal initialization file with only documentation
- Part of pip's internal API (not intended for external consumption)
- Follows standard Python package initialization patterns
