## Purpose
Empty initialization module for pip's legacy dependency resolution system. This file serves as a package marker to make the `legacy` directory a Python package, allowing imports from the legacy resolver components.

## Architecture Context
Part of pip's internal resolution system (`pip._internal.resolution`), specifically the legacy resolver implementation. This package likely contains the original dependency resolution algorithm that was used before pip's newer resolver was introduced.

## Key Components
No classes, functions, or executable code present - this is a standard Python package `__init__.py` file that exists solely to establish the package namespace.

## Dependencies
None - empty file with no imports or dependencies.

## Usage Pattern
This module enables imports such as:
- `from pip._internal.resolution.legacy import <resolver_components>`
- `import pip._internal.resolution.legacy.<module_name>`

The actual resolver implementation would be in sibling modules within this package directory.
