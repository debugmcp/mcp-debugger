## Purpose
This directory contains a comprehensive Go "Hello World" educational example designed for the MCP Debugger tool (v0.17.0). It serves as a learning resource that demonstrates fundamental Go programming concepts and language features in a single, self-contained application.

## Key Components
The module consists of a single `main.go` file containing:

- **main()** - The primary entry point that orchestrates demonstrations of various Go language features
- **add()** - A utility function showcasing basic arithmetic operations and function definitions
- **greet()** - A string formatting function demonstrating parameterized message generation

## Public API Surface
- **Entry Point**: `main()` function serves as the sole executable entry point
- **Utility Functions**: `add()` and `greet()` provide reusable components for arithmetic and string operations
- **External Dependencies**: Relies only on Go's standard `fmt` package for formatted I/O

## Internal Organization & Data Flow
The application follows a linear execution pattern:
1. Variable declarations using Go's short syntax
2. Function calls demonstrating parameter passing and return values
3. Collection operations with slices and maps
4. Iteration patterns using range loops
5. Control flow with conditionals and traditional for loops
6. Structured console output throughout

## Data Structures & Patterns
- **Primitive Types**: Strings and integers with idiomatic Go declarations
- **Collections**: Integer slices and string-to-string maps (color codes)
- **Control Structures**: Range-based iteration, conditional branching, and counter-based loops
- **Output Formatting**: Extensive use of `fmt.Printf` and `fmt.Sprintf` for structured display

## Educational Value
This example effectively demonstrates core Go programming concepts including variable declaration, function definition, collection manipulation, control flow, and formatted output. It provides a practical foundation for understanding Go syntax and idioms while producing clear, structured console output that illustrates each concept in action.
