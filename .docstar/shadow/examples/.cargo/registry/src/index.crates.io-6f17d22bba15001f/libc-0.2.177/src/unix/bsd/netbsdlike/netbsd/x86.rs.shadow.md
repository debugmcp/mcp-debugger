## Purpose
NetBSD x86 architecture-specific type definitions and constants for the libc crate. This file provides low-level platform bindings for x86 NetBSD systems.

## Key Elements
- **__cpu_simple_lock_nv_t** (L3): Type alias defining CPU simple lock as unsigned char, used for low-level synchronization primitives in NetBSD kernel/userspace interface
- **_ALIGNBYTES** (L5): Architecture-specific memory alignment constant, calculated as `sizeof(int) - 1`, typically used for ensuring proper data structure alignment on x86 systems

## Dependencies
- Uses `crate::prelude::*` (L1) for common libc types like `c_uchar` and `c_int`
- Part of NetBSD-like BSD Unix variant hierarchy in libc's platform-specific module structure

## Architectural Notes
- Minimal file focused on x86-specific definitions within NetBSD
- Follows libc's pattern of progressive platform specialization (unix -> bsd -> netbsdlike -> netbsd -> x86)
- Alignment constant reflects x86's 4-byte integer alignment requirements
