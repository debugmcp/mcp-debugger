**Primary Purpose**: Platform-specific definitions for x32 ABI on x86_64 Linux systems within the libc crate. This file provides syscall numbers and data structures specifically adapted for the x32 ABI, which uses 32-bit pointers on x86_64 architecture.

**Key Components**:

**Data Structures**:
- `statvfs` struct (L5-18): Filesystem statistics structure with fields for block sizes, counts, and filesystem metadata. Uses platform-specific type aliases (`fsblkcnt_t`, `fsfilcnt_t`) and includes private spare field `__f_spare`.

**Constants**:
- Pthread object sizes (L21-23): Defines memory layout sizes for pthread synchronization primitives:
  - `__SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEX_T`: 32 bytes
  - `__SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCK_T`: 44 bytes  
  - `__SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIER_T`: 20 bytes

- Pthread mutex initializers (L25-42): Pre-configured mutex initializers for different mutex types (recursive, error-checking, adaptive). Each uses a 32-element array with specific values at index 16 to indicate mutex type.

**X32 Syscall Table** (L44-398):
- `__X32_SYSCALL_BIT` (L46): Base offset 0x40000000 for x32 syscalls
- Complete syscall number definitions following pattern `SYS_name = __X32_SYSCALL_BIT + number`
- Covers standard syscalls (0-450 range) and special x32 syscalls (512-547 range)
- Includes modern syscalls like io_uring, landlock, and futex_waitv

**Dependencies**:
- Imports from crate prelude and pthread types
- Uses crate-level type aliases (`fsblkcnt_t`, `fsfilcnt_t`, `pthread_mutex_t`)
- Relies on C primitive types (`c_long`, `c_ulong`, `c_int`)

**Architectural Notes**:
- X32 ABI specific: 32-bit pointers with x86_64 instruction set
- Syscall numbers offset by `__X32_SYSCALL_BIT` to distinguish from regular x86_64 syscalls
- Thread synchronization object sizes differ from standard x86_64 due to pointer size differences
- Mutex initializers use array-based representation matching glibc's internal structure
