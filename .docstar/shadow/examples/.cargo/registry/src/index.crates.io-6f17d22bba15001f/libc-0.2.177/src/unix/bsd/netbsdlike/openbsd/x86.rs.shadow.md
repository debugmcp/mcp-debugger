**Purpose**: OpenBSD x86 architecture-specific constants for the libc crate's Unix BSD layer.

**Key Constants**:
- `_ALIGNBYTES` (L3): Memory alignment boundary calculation, derived from `c_int` size minus 1. Used internally for platform-specific memory alignment operations.
- `_MAX_PAGE_SHIFT` (L5): Maximum page size shift value (12 bits = 4KB pages), defines upper bound for virtual memory page size calculations on OpenBSD x86.

**Dependencies**: 
- Uses crate's prelude for common types and utilities
- Relies on `c_int` type from libc type definitions

**Architecture Context**: Part of the hierarchical platform abstraction in libc crate (`unix/bsd/netbsdlike/openbsd/x86`), providing x86-specific constants for OpenBSD memory management and system operations.

**Usage Pattern**: These constants are typically consumed by higher-level memory allocation and page management functions within the libc crate's OpenBSD implementation.
