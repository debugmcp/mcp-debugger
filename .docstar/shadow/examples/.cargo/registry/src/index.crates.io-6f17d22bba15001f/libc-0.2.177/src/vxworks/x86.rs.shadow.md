## Purpose
Platform-specific type definitions for VxWorks on x86 architecture. This file provides the x86-specific implementation of platform-dependent types for the VxWorks real-time operating system.

## Key Types
- **wchar_t** (L1): Wide character type alias defined as `i32` (32-bit signed integer) for VxWorks x86 platform

## Architecture Context
This file is part of the libc crate's platform-specific type system. It defines how wide characters are represented on VxWorks x86 systems, where they are 32-bit signed integers rather than the 16-bit representation used on some other platforms.

## Dependencies
- Inherits from the broader VxWorks platform definitions
- Part of the libc crate's cross-platform type abstraction system

## Usage Pattern
This type definition enables portable code to use `wchar_t` consistently across platforms while maintaining platform-specific binary compatibility for VxWorks x86 systems.
