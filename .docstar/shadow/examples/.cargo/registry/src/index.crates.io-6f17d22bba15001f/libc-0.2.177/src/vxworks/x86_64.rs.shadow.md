**Primary Purpose**: Platform-specific type definitions for VxWorks on x86_64 architecture.

**Functionality**: Defines architecture-specific type aliases to ensure proper C interoperability on VxWorks x86_64 systems.

**Key Type Definitions**:
- `wchar_t` (L1): Wide character type aliased to `i32` (32-bit signed integer), following VxWorks x86_64 ABI conventions

**Dependencies**: Part of the libc crate's platform-specific type system, consumed by higher-level VxWorks modules.

**Architectural Context**: This file is part of libc's platform abstraction layer, providing the foundation for wide character operations on VxWorks x86_64. The `i32` mapping ensures compatibility with VxWorks's wide character implementation on 64-bit x86 systems.

**Usage Pattern**: Type definitions are imported by modules requiring wide character support on VxWorks x86_64 platforms.
