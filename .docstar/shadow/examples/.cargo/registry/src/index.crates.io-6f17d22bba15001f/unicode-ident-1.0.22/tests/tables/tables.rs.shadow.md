## Primary Purpose
Auto-generated Unicode identifier tables containing XID (eXtended IDentifier) property definitions for Unicode 17.0.0. These tables define which Unicode code points are valid for identifier start and continuation characters, used for Unicode-aware lexical analysis and identifier validation.

## Key Constants and Data Structures
- **BY_NAME (L9-11)**: Lookup table mapping property names to their corresponding Unicode range arrays. Contains mappings for "XID_Continue" and "XID_Start" properties.
- **XID_CONTINUE (L13-199)**: Extensive array of Unicode code point ranges (u32 tuples) defining characters that can continue an identifier. Includes digits (48-57), letters (65-90, 97-122), combining marks, and thousands of Unicode ranges covering various scripts and symbol sets.
- **XID_START (L201-361)**: Array of Unicode code point ranges defining characters that can start an identifier. Similar to XID_CONTINUE but excludes digits and some combining characters that are only valid in continuation positions.

## Data Format
Each range is represented as a tuple `(start, end)` of u32 Unicode code points, defining inclusive ranges of valid characters. The tables are sorted and optimized for efficient binary search operations.

## Dependencies and Context
- Generated by `ucd-generate` tool version 0.3.1 using Unicode Character Database (UCD)
- Part of the `unicode-ident` crate's test infrastructure
- Follows Unicode Standard Annex #31 identifier specifications
- Static lifetime arrays for zero-allocation lookups

## Architectural Notes
The tables are auto-generated and should not be manually edited. They provide comprehensive coverage of Unicode identifier characters across all scripts and planes, enabling proper internationalization support in lexers and parsers.
