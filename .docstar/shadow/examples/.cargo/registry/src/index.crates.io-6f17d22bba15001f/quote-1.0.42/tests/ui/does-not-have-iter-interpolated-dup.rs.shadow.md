**Purpose**: UI test file for the `quote` crate that verifies compiler error handling for malformed repetition syntax.

**Test Scenario**: This test validates that the `quote!` macro properly rejects repetition patterns that lack proper iterator interpolation, preventing infinite loops during macro expansion.

**Key Components**:
- `nonrep` variable (L4): A simple string literal that is not an iterator
- `quote!` macro invocation (L8): Uses repetition syntax `#(#nonrep #nonrep)*` which should fail compilation
- Error condition: The repetition pattern references `nonrep` twice within `#()*` without any actual iterator, which would cause infinite expansion

**Expected Behavior**: This code should fail to compile with an appropriate error message about missing iterator in repetition pattern. The test serves as a negative case to ensure the macro system's safety mechanisms work correctly.

**Dependencies**: 
- `quote` crate for the `quote!` macro (L1)

**Architectural Pattern**: UI test pattern - designed to fail compilation and verify specific error messages are generated by the compiler when using the quote macro incorrectly.
