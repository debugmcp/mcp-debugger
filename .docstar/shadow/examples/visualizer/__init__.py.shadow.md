## Purpose
Package initialization file for the MCP Debugger TUI Visualizer module. This module provides a terminal-based user interface for visualizing debugging sessions from MCP debugger server logs.

## Structure
- **Package docstring (L1-6)**: Describes the module's purpose as a terminal-based visualization tool for MCP debugging sessions
- No classes, functions, or imports defined - serves as a simple package marker

## Dependencies
None explicitly defined in this file.

## Architecture Notes
This is a minimal `__init__.py` file that only provides package-level documentation. The actual implementation likely resides in other modules within the `visualizer` package. The focus on "debugging sessions from MCP debugger server logs" suggests this package processes log files to create visual representations in a terminal interface.

## Key Concepts
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: The protocol being debugged
- **TUI (Terminal User Interface)**: Text-based interface paradigm
- **Log visualization**: Primary function of converting debug logs into visual representations
