## Purpose and Responsibility
Package initialization file for the MCP Debugger TUI Visualizer - a terminal-based user interface component designed to visualize debugging sessions from MCP (Model Context Protocol) debugger server logs.

## Package Structure
This is a minimal `__init__.py` file (L1-6) that serves as the package entry point for the visualizer module. Contains only package-level documentation describing the overall purpose.

## Key Components
- **Module Documentation** (L1-6): Docstring explaining the package's role as a TUI (Terminal User Interface) for MCP debugging visualization

## Dependencies and Relationships
- Part of the larger MCP debugger ecosystem
- Designed to consume and visualize logs from MCP debugger servers
- Focuses on terminal-based visualization rather than GUI components

## Architectural Notes
- Minimal initialization file suggests implementation details are in submodules
- Terminal-based approach indicates focus on developer/debugging workflows
- Log-based visualization implies asynchronous or post-hoc analysis capabilities
