**Purpose**: x32 ABI-specific system call constants and data structures for GNU/Linux on x86_64. The x32 ABI provides 32-bit pointers with access to 64-bit registers and system calls.

**Key Components:**

- **statvfs struct (L5-18)**: File system statistics structure with standard fields for block counts, file counts, and filesystem metadata. Contains private `__f_spare` padding field.

- **Pthread constants (L21-42)**: 
  - Mutex/rwlock/barrier sizing constants (L21-23)
  - Specialized mutex initializers for recursive (L25-30), error-checking (L31-36), and adaptive (L37-42) mutexes with hardcoded byte arrays

- **X32 syscall table (L46-398)**: Complete mapping of Linux system calls with x32 ABI bit flag
  - `__X32_SYSCALL_BIT` (L46): Core x32 identifier `0x40000000`
  - Standard syscalls (L48-362): File I/O, process management, memory operations, networking
  - Signal/async syscalls (L363-398): Real-time signals, vectored I/O, async I/O operations

**Architecture Notes:**
- All syscall numbers include `__X32_SYSCALL_BIT` offset to distinguish from regular x86_64 calls
- Syscall numbering follows Linux kernel x32 ABI specification
- Some gaps in numbering reflect kernel evolution and deprecated syscalls
- Higher-numbered syscalls (512+) represent newer kernel features

**Dependencies:**
- Uses crate prelude and pthread_mutex_t from parent modules
- Relies on filesystem and C type definitions from libc hierarchy

**Critical Invariants:**
- X32 syscall bit must be set for all system calls in this ABI
- Mutex initializer arrays must match exact kernel ABI layout
- statvfs structure layout must align with kernel expectations
