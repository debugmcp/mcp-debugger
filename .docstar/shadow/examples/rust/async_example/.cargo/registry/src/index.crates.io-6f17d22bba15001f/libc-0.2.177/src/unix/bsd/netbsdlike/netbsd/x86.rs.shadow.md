## Purpose
Platform-specific x86 architecture definitions for NetBSD operating system within the libc crate. Provides low-level system types and constants required for x86-specific operations on NetBSD.

## Key Elements
- **__cpu_simple_lock_nv_t (L3)**: Type alias defining CPU simple lock as unsigned char, used for low-level synchronization primitives
- **_ALIGNBYTES (L5)**: Architecture-specific alignment constant calculated as `size_of::<c_int>() - 1`, determines memory alignment requirements for x86 NetBSD

## Dependencies
- **crate::prelude::* (L1)**: Imports common libc types and constants (likely includes c_uchar, c_int, size_of)

## Architectural Context
- Part of libc's hierarchical platform abstraction: unix → bsd → netbsdlike → netbsd → x86
- Provides x86-specific implementations that override or supplement generic NetBSD definitions
- Critical for ensuring proper memory alignment and synchronization on x86 NetBSD systems

## Usage Pattern
Constants and types defined here are consumed by higher-level libc functions requiring platform-specific behavior, particularly in threading, memory management, and system calls.
