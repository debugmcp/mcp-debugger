## Purpose
Platform-specific constants for OpenBSD on x86 architecture within the libc crate's Unix BSD hierarchy. Defines memory alignment and virtual memory page size parameters essential for low-level system interactions.

## Key Constants
- `_ALIGNBYTES` (L3): Memory alignment boundary constant calculated as `size_of::<c_int>() - 1`, typically evaluating to 3 bytes (4-1) for 32-bit integers on x86
- `_MAX_PAGE_SHIFT` (L5): Maximum page size shift value set to 12, indicating 4KB pages (2^12 = 4096 bytes) as the standard page size on OpenBSD x86

## Dependencies
- `crate::prelude::*` (L1): Imports common libc types including `c_int` and `size_of` function
- `size_of::<c_int>()`: Runtime calculation of C integer size for platform-specific alignment

## Architectural Context
This file sits in the platform-specific hierarchy: `unix/bsd/netbsdlike/openbsd/x86`, providing x86-specific constants that override or supplement more general BSD/Unix definitions. The constants support memory management operations, structure padding calculations, and virtual memory subsystem interactions on OpenBSD x86 systems.
