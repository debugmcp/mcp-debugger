# Test Fixes Summary - Path Validation Update

## Overview
Successfully updated 3 failing tests to work with the new path validation implementation. All tests now pass (996 tests total).

## Tests Fixed

### 1. Error Scenarios E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/error-scenarios.test.ts`)

**Test: `should handle non-existent file for breakpoint`**
- **Before**: Expected breakpoint to be set with `verified: false` or fail gracefully
- **After**: Expects immediate MCP error with "File not found" message
- **Change**: Wrapped call in try/catch to handle thrown error

**Test: `should handle invalid script path for debugging`**
- **Before**: Expected `start_debugging` to succeed initially, then session would transition to error state
- **After**: Expects immediate MCP error with "File not found" message
- **Change**: Removed wait logic, added try/catch for immediate error

### 2. Python Discovery Failure Test (`tests/adapters/python/integration/python-discovery.failure.test.ts`)

**Test: `should error when Python is not found in PATH`**
- **Problem**: Using incorrect relative path that resolved to non-existent file
- **Fix**: Changed from `../../../examples/python/fibonacci.py` to `examples/python/fibonacci.py`
- **Result**: Test now properly validates the file exists, then tests Python discovery failure

## Key Changes

1. **Error Handling Pattern**: Tests now use try/catch blocks to handle immediate validation errors
```typescript
try {
  await mcpClient!.callTool({
    name: 'set_breakpoint',
    arguments: { sessionId, file: 'non-existent.py', line: 4 }
  });
  expect(true).toBe(false); // Should not reach here
} catch (error: any) {
  expect(error.message).toContain('File not found');
}
```

2. **Path Resolution**: Fixed incorrect relative paths to use proper project-relative paths

3. **Removed Async Wait Logic**: No longer waiting for session state transitions since validation happens immediately

## Benefits

- Tests accurately reflect the new validation behavior
- Clear, immediate feedback when files don't exist
- No more waiting for debug adapter errors
- Tests run faster without unnecessary timeouts

## Test Results
- Total test files: 65 (all passed)
- Total tests: 996 (all passed)
- Code coverage: 87.69% overall
- Path validator coverage: 85.71%
